1
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:43,897
Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch. Bastard!

2
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:45,640
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.

3
00:00:45,675 --> 00:00:47,230
Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come.

4
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:48,822
Thy will be done, you fuck!

5
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,422
Give us this day our daily bread, as we forgive those who trespass against us.

6
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:54,385
Jesus, Jesus the Nazarene.

7
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:56,939
Jesus, the Nazarene. Go to hell. Go to hell. Go to hell.

8
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,433
Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!

9
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:03,127
Jim, you're not going to waste the whole day lying around, are you?

10
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:06,288
Ma, I'm up. The loony alarm went off.

11
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:09,551
Well, close the blinds. Don't look at her and don't listen to her.

12
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:10,494
How could I not?

13
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:13,230
Jesus the Nazarene.

14
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:15,389
Mary the whore. Mary the hairdresser.

15
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:17,164
Mary the hairdresser. Our Father, Who art...

16
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:18,304
Hey, lady!

17
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:19,340
Shut up!

18
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:30,015
When I was young, about 8 or so,

19
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:32,074
I tried making friends with God...

20
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:34,999
by inviting him to my house to watch the World Series.

21
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:37,789
He never showed.

22
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,284
Too bad, Father. I was just starting to enjoy myself.

23
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:27,236
We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll.

24
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:44,555
You okay, Jim? Does it hurt?

25
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,177
You want to rub it for him, Pedro?

26
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:49,311
Jim, give it a rest. You'll never beat him.

27
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:50,475
The guy's a pervert.

28
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,569
Did you hear him?

29
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,680
"We can do it again tomorrow if you like, Mr. Carroll."

30
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,834
Let's cut out of here. Come on.

31
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:08,005
I was born in a pool

32
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,930
They made my mother stand

33
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:11,651
I spat on that surgeon

34
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:13,353
And his trembling hand

35
00:03:13,388 --> 00:03:15,063
When I felt the light

36
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:16,849
I was worse than bored

37
00:03:16,884 --> 00:03:18,601
I stole a doctor's scalpel

38
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:20,503
And I slit the cord

39
00:03:20,816 --> 00:03:23,547
I was a Catholic boy

40
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:26,018
I was redeemed through pain

41
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:27,692
Not through joy

42
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:32,373
I was two months early

43
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:33,853
They put me under glass

44
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:35,654
I screamed and cursed their children

45
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:37,240
When the nurses passed

46
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:38,928
I was convicted of theft

47
00:03:38,963 --> 00:03:40,546
As I slid from the womb

48
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:42,221
They led me straight from my mother

49
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,649
To a cell in the tombs

50
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:47,773
I was a Catholic boy

51
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:50,119
Redeemed through pain

52
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:51,625
Not through joy

53
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:55,617
They starved me for weeks

54
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,388
They thought they'd teach me fear

55
00:03:57,423 --> 00:03:59,173
I fed on cellmates' dreams

56
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,971
It gave me fine ideas

57
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:02,699
When they cut me loose

58
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:04,563
The time had served me well

59
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:06,393
I'd made allies in heaven

60
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:08,494
Comrades in hell

61
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:11,464
I was a Catholic child

62
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:17,424
The blood ran red

63
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,007
The blood ran wild

64
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:26,214
Why, you little prick! This is my new...

65
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:28,568
Shit, guys, gotta get outta here. I threw up on somebody.

66
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:29,631
I'll get ya!

67
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:37,549
You little prick!

68
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:42,760
I'll fucking throw you in the fucking river if i catch ya...

69
00:04:57,603 --> 00:04:58,736
Hey!

70
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,101
What about the four of us versus Wilt Chamberlain?

71
00:05:05,136 --> 00:05:06,488
He was the greatest of all time.

72
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:07,118
Four of us?

73
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:08,283
What are you gonna do, Pedro?

74
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:09,722
tie his shoes together when he ain't looking?

75
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,827
All right... How'bout the three versus Wilt Chamberlain?

76
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,414
No problem.

77
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:15,423
You're kidding, right, Mickey?

78
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,679
No. He can't cover all of us at the same time.

79
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,808
You guys don't miss open jumpers.

80
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:22,736
And you know who will be there for the rebounds.

81
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:25,877
Rebounds? That freak is, like, 7 feet tall.

82
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:28,324
Jim, I can rebound with anybody.

83
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,488
You're sniffing too much of that shit, that's what you're doing.

84
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:34,113
Chamberlain would destroy all of us. End of story.

85
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:36,147
Alright. All we got to do is move the ball around.

86
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:38,921
- There's no way we don't win. - Will you tell this kid?

87
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:40,780
Hey, Mickey, I think you could beat him yourself.

88
00:05:40,815 --> 00:05:42,482
I don't think you need us.

89
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:44,689
Perfect example... confidence. I know I could beat him.

90
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,578
Holy shit! Look at this place.

91
00:05:47,737 --> 00:05:49,815
I tell you what, if our school was this nice,

92
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,759
I'd go more than once a week.

93
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:52,025
You?

94
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:56,145
We got a game today, gentlemen.

95
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:58,277
Who's ready to play some roundball?

96
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:01,444
I said, who's ready to play some ball?

97
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:03,780
You give me that laid-back,

98
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:06,579
"I'm doing my own thing, Jack" attitude out there today,

99
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:09,527
and you're going to find yourself watching the game from the bench.

100
00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:13,682
No smoking, Iggy... stunts your growth.

101
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:16,365
You want to be big and strong like me, don't you?

102
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,459
Out.

103
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,996
No smoking,

104
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:23,686
and no pulling your peckers before a game.

105
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:28,244
Swifty, do you mind? I'm taking a dump. Get outta here!

106
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:30,718
Something die in there?

107
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:31,940
When we play our game...

108
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,233
...so Pedro vomits on his head, right?

109
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,742
It goes all over his hair, trickles down his neck.

110
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:39,081
Some gets in his eye. He went nuts...

111
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:41,065
Don't lie about it, either.

112
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,950
What are you doing?

113
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:44,625
We're signing a ball for Bobby.

114
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,907
Can I sign?

115
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,394
Yeah.

116
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:58,297
"We're holding your spot for you, kid.

117
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:00,026
Swifty."

118
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:02,536
All right.

119
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:05,919
This one's for Bobby.

120
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,919
All right.

121
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:12,159
Who's better than we are?

122
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:13,649
Nobody!

123
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,550
Alright! Go ahead. Do some warm-ups.

124
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:17,154
Pedro, you're in charge.

125
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:18,736
You're my eyes and ears.

126
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:23,514
- Hey, Jim? - Yeah?

127
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:27,799
That's a nice thing you're doing for Bobby.

128
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:29,633
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

129
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:32,611
You seen Neutron?

130
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:36,419
I think he's talking to a scout from Saint John's, as a matter of fact, upstairs.

131
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:39,283
You want to play college ball, don't you?

132
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:41,389
Yeah. Someday, I hope. You know.

133
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:43,279
Yeah.

134
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:45,072
Scouts are sniffing you out already.

135
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:46,316
They like them young.

136
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:49,818
I'll tell you what.

137
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,154
You come by sometime, and we'll go over the schools together.

138
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,243
Yeah. All right.

139
00:07:56,278 --> 00:07:59,132
Yeah. We'll get a pizza, and we'll make a night of it.

140
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,324
Um... actually, my nights are kind of busy right now.

141
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,252
Yeah.

142
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:07,630
Homework and all, huh?

143
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:09,162
Yeah. Yeah.

144
00:08:12,488 --> 00:08:15,077
We were the hottest Catholic high school team in New York City,

145
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:17,441
on our way to the championship.

146
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:20,000
We felt like nothing could stop us.

147
00:08:23,613 --> 00:08:24,929
Yeah! Yeah!

148
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,546
Yes! We're on our way.

149
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:27,965
We're on our way.

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,315
Let's go. Let's go.

151
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,926
Hands up. Show me some defense.

152
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:32,361
Show me some defense.

153
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:34,353
Good steal. Put it in. Put it in.

154
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,603
Yeah!

155
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:39,950
All right. All right.

156
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,776
Way to go.

157
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:44,647
Aw, geez.

158
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:47,153
All right, Neutron. Yes! Yes!

159
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:48,243
To the hole, Jim.

160
00:08:50,976 --> 00:08:52,884
Whoa! Whoa! What's going on?

161
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,884
Break it up!

162
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,428
Come on. Hit him! Beat that motherfucker!

163
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:05,294
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! - He fucking held me!

164
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:06,618
This dude blows the whistle...

165
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:09,758
Slow it down! Slow it down!

166
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:38,288
You got to have presence on the court...

167
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:40,959
presence like a cheetah rather than a chimp.

168
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:42,418
They both got it,

169
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:44,863
but chimpy got to jump his nuts around all day to get it.

170
00:09:45,717 --> 00:09:48,695
Shy cheetah just moves in total nonchalance

171
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:52,512
a sec or two in his sexy, slow strut.

172
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:55,443
Me, I play like a cheetah.

173
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,225
Let's go, Rangers...

174
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:05,825
let's go!

175
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:08,455
Let's go, Rangers, let's go!

176
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:15,959
Yeah! Ooh!

177
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,969
You got it! It's ours. It's ours.

178
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:41,494
Oh!

179
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:42,572
Yeah!

180
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:43,687
9, 8,

181
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:44,674
7,
6,

182
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:46,657
5,
4,

183
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,308
3,
2,

184
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:50,088
1!

185
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:52,202
Yay, Jim! Oh, shit.

186
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:54,009
That's my team! That's my team!

187
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,831
There's only two things Swifty forbids...

188
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,081
using the word "motherfucker"

189
00:11:01,116 --> 00:11:03,296
and stealing from the other team,

190
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,059
as long as they're white.

191
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,095
How much for that group of winners over there?

192
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,757
It's $34.90.

193
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,148
$34.90?

194
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:12,607
Changed the prices or something?

195
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:13,767
No.

196
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:17,004
Uh...

197
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:18,947
I'm a little short.

198
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:21,136
Do me a favor. Here. Take my watch,

199
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:23,704
and I'll come back later with the rest of the money.

200
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:26,913
No.

201
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:28,494
What do you mean, no?

202
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:29,742
I'm sorry, sir.

203
00:11:29,777 --> 00:11:31,972
Those burgers are worth more than the watch is.

204
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:34,213
I'll be right back.

205
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:38,560
I told you one burger each, didn't I?

206
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,636
It takes at least eight of these to get filled up.

207
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:44,439
Yeah. C'mon, Swifty. We're growing boys.

208
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:46,207
Growing boys? We're hungry motherfuckers.

209
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:48,569
Funny, huh?

210
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:50,276
I'm not driving you guys home.

211
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:51,864
How's that for laughs?

212
00:11:58,257 --> 00:12:00,143
You ripped them off, didn't you?

213
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:08,081
We're even now.

214
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:09,640
Swifty, come on. How are we going to get home?

215
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:11,356
Face the music, pricks.

216
00:12:13,986 --> 00:12:15,807
What are we going to do? They got the door blocked off.

217
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:17,232
You afraid of these pussies?

218
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:18,622
I ain't afraid of anybody.

219
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:25,825
What's the problem?

220
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,085
I'm going to ask you this once. All right?

221
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,091
Where's the stuff you stole from me?

222
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:32,734
What are you talking about?

223
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,482
No, no, no. You're not going to fuck with me, all right?

224
00:12:35,517 --> 00:12:39,106
Now, somebody stole my father's ring from my locker, motherfucker.

225
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:41,334
You want me to cut you? Is that what you want, there?

226
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:43,440
There's no problem here.

227
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:09,620
Hey, guys! Let's get out of here, c'mon!

228
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:13,101
You need a fucking army, huh?

229
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,814
Come on! Come on!

230
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:28,386
Oh. Nice. That from Bobo?

231
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:30,193
Ha ha ha!

232
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:31,834
That's his father's ring.

233
00:13:34,784 --> 00:13:37,843
Hey, fellas. Any of you looking for a date?

234
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:39,799
Yeah. Me, sweetheart.

235
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:41,635
Little horsy ride in Central Park,

236
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,766
maybe candlelight dinner?

237
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:45,982
Why don't we skip right to dessert, huh, baby?

238
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:47,398
About $15?

239
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:50,360
Fifteen bucks? I'll give you a quarter. Let Pedro suck your tits.

240
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,068
You don't have to be rude.

241
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:54,705
Oh, I'm sorry.

242
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:57,602
How about you, handsome, huh?

243
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,157
You got $15... for a little head?

244
00:14:01,431 --> 00:14:03,421
Diane, do I look like I need to pay for it?

245
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,001
Yeah...

246
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:06,547
you do.

247
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,657
If it's worth it.

248
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:10,387
Jimmy...

249
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:13,936
Jimmy, I know you want some, honey.

250
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:19,058
$15. I'll do you so good you'll never forget it, baby.

251
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:20,733
Hey, hey!

252
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:21,812
Ooh!

253
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:23,696
That's a deal.

254
00:14:23,731 --> 00:14:25,421
Bargain from there.

255
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:28,339
What do you say, guys? You want to do it? All four of us?

256
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:30,117
- Yeah. - It's a deal.

257
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:31,205
All four of us.

258
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,559
Aw, shit. This is all I got, Diane.

259
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:38,806
Here, have a pretzel.

260
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:41,493
- Get out of here. - Beat it.

261
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:42,739
Yeah, fuck you!

262
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,164
Fucking dopehead. You see what that shit does to you?

263
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:48,804
Wow. Speaking of dopeheads,

264
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,670
is that Pedro's mother over there slinging her wares again?

265
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,754
It is!

266
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,000
Hey, Peepee, where you going?

267
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:02,673
Why do you have to be such an asshole all the time, huh?

268
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:05,567
Why is the little shoe crying anyway?

269
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:07,763
His mother's a sneaker. His father's a loafer.

270
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,028
Somebody's got to be a heel.

271
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,314
Jim, where you going?

272
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:15,851
Hey, Jim!

273
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,943
Jim.

274
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,694
Hey. Hey, man.

275
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:23,141
What's up?

276
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:25,437
You don't recognize me with my new hairdo?

277
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:28,025
It's nice. It's nice. I like it.

278
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:30,064
What's going on?

279
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:31,506
- How are you? - Good.

280
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:34,415
Wow. Look at that.

281
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,565
You like it?

282
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,627
Yeah, I'll tell you what. When you get out of here,

283
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,864
we'll all shave our heads and look like a gang of skinheads.

284
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:41,341
It's a deal.

285
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:42,135
All right.

286
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,772
I got something for you here.

287
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:44,629
Yeah.

288
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:47,552
Everyone on the team.

289
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,393
Look right here... even Swifty signed it.

290
00:15:51,214 --> 00:15:52,570
Thanks, man.

291
00:15:55,044 --> 00:15:58,549
You remember when I dunked on that spade in Riverside Park?

292
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:00,687
You always had good ups.

293
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:01,992
Yeah.

294
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,743
Oh. I got something to show you. Hold on.

295
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,900
What?

296
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:11,260
Pedro got these out of some lady's purse.

297
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:17,231
- She's doing it with a donkey. - Oh, Jesus!

298
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:19,143
Look at that schlong. Look at that one.

299
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,513
Oh, I beat your record.

300
00:16:22,212 --> 00:16:23,719
How many times you choke it?

301
00:16:23,754 --> 00:16:24,975
Seven times.

302
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,430
Bullshit.

303
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:27,816
Seven times.

304
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,542
My mom thinks I have a cold year-round

305
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:31,672
because of all the tissues around the house.

306
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,409
You can keep those if you want.

307
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,821
They're pumping so much junk in me,

308
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:48,379
I can't even get a decent chubby.

309
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:55,343
I got an idea.

310
00:16:58,072 --> 00:16:59,703
Come on. Let's go.

311
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:01,382
Where we going?

312
00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:03,237
I'm getting you out of this place, man. C'mon!

313
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:06,495
What are you, crazy, man? I can't go anywhere.

314
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,155
Here you go.

315
00:17:08,516 --> 00:17:12,051
I've known Bobby since I was 3. He's my best friend.

316
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:14,947
He was the best player on our basketball team.

317
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:17,524
Two years ago, he got leukemia.

318
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,945
He keeps fighting it off.

319
00:17:20,676 --> 00:17:22,342
I know Bobby's going to beat it.

320
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:24,753
He could beat anything.

321
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:26,851
Watch!

322
00:17:28,979 --> 00:17:31,274
Jim, you're going to kill me, man.

323
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:32,901
If you let go, I swear...

324
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,907
I swear I'll kill you, man.

325
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:37,785
Watch the bump!

326
00:17:38,106 --> 00:17:40,096
What the hell happened to forty deuce?

327
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:43,764
Last time I was here, that theater was playing Sperminator II.

328
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,209
Oh, yeah. I remember that.

329
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:49,272
No, man. This whole block has been done over by all these new artists.

330
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:50,956
It's pretty cool, huh?

331
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:52,214
Yeah.

332
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:56,557
They should put your stuff up there.

333
00:17:58,185 --> 00:17:59,332
Yeah. Right.

334
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:03,145
Still scribbling stuff in that notebook of yours, ain't you?

335
00:18:03,702 --> 00:18:05,051
Of course.

336
00:18:06,164 --> 00:18:07,701
You bring anything for me?

337
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:09,460
What, like to read?

338
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:11,289
No, like to eat.

339
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,771
What do you think?

340
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:17,291
Yeah. I mean, I got this, but it's not a big deal.

341
00:18:17,326 --> 00:18:19,859
I don't even remember writing it, to tell you the truth.

342
00:18:19,894 --> 00:18:22,656
Yeah, Yeah. I'll be the judge of this.

343
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,588
"Little kids shoot marbles

344
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:30,189
"where branches break the sun

345
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:32,930
"into graceful shafts of light.

346
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,349
I just want to be pure."

347
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:41,349
I just want to be pure.

348
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:50,219
All right.

349
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,762
What a life

350
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:57,914
Nothing like the real thing to float your boat, huh, Bobby?

351
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,011
What a life

352
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:06,091
Didn't know where, didn't know when...

353
00:19:07,003 --> 00:19:08,340
That's nice.

354
00:19:08,807 --> 00:19:11,433
Said that I'll go... go learn

355
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:14,024
Put up my hand, wait my turn

356
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:16,114
But it never comes, I have to shout out

357
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:17,376
That's life

358
00:19:17,411 --> 00:19:18,834
And that's what it's all about

359
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:22,043
So through the comfort and the strife

360
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,392
What a life...

361
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:33,657
Get me out of here, Jim.

362
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:36,014
What are you talking about, man?

363
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,445
This was a stupid idea.

364
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,090
I don't feel so good.

365
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:45,674
Well, can we wait till the end of the show?

366
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:48,631
Did you hear what I said? I said get me the hell out of here!

367
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,363
Hey, Bob, man...

368
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:22,226
I'm really sorry, you know? Next time, we'll go somewhere...

369
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:24,028
Ain't gonna be no next time, Jim.

370
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:41,260
I love it this way...

371
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:44,879
my feet against the tar, which is soft from the spring heat,

372
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:48,235
the slight breeze that runs across your entire body,

373
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,786
especially your crotch.

374
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:54,427
You feel an incredible power being naked under a dome of stars

375
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:58,753
while a giant city is dressed, dodging cars all around you five flights down.

376
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,226
I don't think of anything while I'm doing the actual tugging,

377
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:07,722
least of all the heavy sex fantasies I have to resort to indoors.

378
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:11,895
Just my own naked self and the stars breathing down,

379
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:14,408
and it's beautiful.

380
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:17,847
Time sure flies when you're young and jerking off.

381
00:21:20,277 --> 00:21:23,484
"Camp summer position.

382
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:25,519
Driver... taxi."

383
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:29,651
Hey, that might be good. You could get your license this summer.

384
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,502
Oh, yeah, Mom. That sounds really great.

385
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:35,296
Hey, get your own job,

386
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:37,412
and if you don't get it this summer,

387
00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:39,844
you're coming to work with me at the hotel.

388
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:42,242
Mom, please. Why are you so worried about this?

389
00:21:42,277 --> 00:21:43,521
Do I even ask you for money?

390
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:45,796
No. I'm not worried about the money.

391
00:21:45,831 --> 00:21:48,001
I want you to have responsibility.

392
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:51,004
I don't want you running around the streets of New York.

393
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,872
Idle time is the devil's plaything, Jim.

394
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:56,623
The devil's plaything, huh?

395
00:21:56,658 --> 00:21:58,127
Mm-hmm.

396
00:21:58,162 --> 00:22:01,116
That might be a cool title for my first book. Thanks!

397
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:05,167
What are you talking about? What are you writing?

398
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:07,487
Here.

399
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:10,935
Ooh. Um...

400
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:13,604
Ma, I'm not really that hungry this morning, alright?

401
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:15,744
- Come on. You got to eat something. - I know...

402
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,909
Where you going?

403
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,365
I'm going to shoot some hoops.

404
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:21,805
Sometimes I feel like something's chasing me,

405
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,290
like there's some whacko on a roof somewhere

406
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:25,816
who could snuff me out at any moment.

407
00:22:25,851 --> 00:22:29,288
And I feel this horrible fear. Will I have time to finish...

408
00:22:29,323 --> 00:22:31,173
the poems breaking loose in my head?

409
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:35,744
Hey, white boy,

410
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:37,578
you ready for your beating?

411
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:40,674
Don't let your mouth get you into something your ass can't handle.

412
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:43,246
I'll shoot you for it.

413
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,250
So it's going to be like that, huh?

414
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:52,442
I...

415
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:54,118
don't think so.

416
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:56,820
Yeah!

417
00:22:56,855 --> 00:22:58,515
All right, so you made one.

418
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,176
Big deal. You made one shot.

419
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:01,364
Make another.

420
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:04,951
The days are muzzled in a vibe

421
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:08,720
I swing back from time to time

422
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:12,420
There's a Camaro, rusty red

423
00:23:12,455 --> 00:23:16,346
That all my best friends drive in

424
00:23:16,381 --> 00:23:20,202
Can you smell the summer air?

425
00:23:20,237 --> 00:23:24,477
Take me where they left the light on

426
00:23:24,512 --> 00:23:27,594
Getting close, almost there

427
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:30,676
If that fuzzy silver badge

428
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:34,731
Don't greet us there

429
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:40,142
My head's dizzy, and I'm taking...

430
00:23:40,177 --> 00:23:42,557
Yo, Jim! What's the score? Come on. We got to go.

431
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,007
They don't keep score in this game.

432
00:23:45,188 --> 00:23:47,406
Jim, come on. We're losing the sun.

433
00:23:51,123 --> 00:23:53,419
He's being a dick. You want me to put a charge in his ass?

434
00:23:53,454 --> 00:23:54,293
Whatch this.

435
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:55,394
Oh, look it, right here...

436
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:01,006
Jim's secret diary he's always writing in.

437
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,035
Bet you he wrote some shit about me.

438
00:24:05,598 --> 00:24:06,710
Oh, right here.

439
00:24:06,972 --> 00:24:08,266
"Spring... Mickey."

440
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:12,166
Hey, there I am, Jim says.

441
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:15,071
"Mickey takes out a bottle of carbonic cleaning fluid

442
00:24:15,106 --> 00:24:17,942
and suggests we do a little sniffing to get high."

443
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:19,431
Whoo!

444
00:24:19,466 --> 00:24:23,157
"After four deep whiffs, we're sailing someplace else."

445
00:24:23,192 --> 00:24:24,643
Mickey, what are you doing?

446
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:26,059
"Bells ringing through my ears,

447
00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:28,560
little lights flashing through my eyes."

448
00:24:28,595 --> 00:24:30,484
Mickey, put that down, all right?

449
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,707
"I pictured myself

450
00:24:31,742 --> 00:24:33,816
"paddling across a river with black water,

451
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:36,392
"only the canoe was going backwards instead of forwards,

452
00:24:36,427 --> 00:24:40,138
"with clouds that had faces. Laughing, spooky, fun-house laughs..."

453
00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:42,210
- Give it back, alright? - What is that shit?

454
00:24:42,245 --> 00:24:44,248
Why do you have to be such a schmuck, Mickey?

455
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:45,306
What are you talking about?

456
00:24:45,341 --> 00:24:47,772
Don't you ever touch that again. It's private.

457
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,498
What's your problem?

458
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:51,831
I'm... I'm sorry.

459
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:56,269
He's writing about me, I can't read about it? Jesus!

460
00:24:56,304 --> 00:24:57,930
Hey, Jim, come on. We're gone.

461
00:24:57,965 --> 00:24:59,406
Yo, we got a cab!

462
00:24:59,441 --> 00:25:01,543
Hey, cabby! Hey, swami!

463
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:03,570
So, Shakespeare,

464
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:05,097
you going to finish the game?

465
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:07,887
C'mon, Reggie, you know this game never ends.

466
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:09,958
See you later, all right?

467
00:25:12,314 --> 00:25:15,491
Every crowd has its little games to prove if you're a punk or not.

468
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:18,247
My cousin in Jersey plays chickie,

469
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:20,549
which is two cars heading towards each other

470
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:22,434
at about 80 miles per hour.

471
00:25:23,098 --> 00:25:26,025
First driver to swerve out of the way is, of course, chicken.

472
00:25:27,883 --> 00:25:28,795
In Brooklyn,

473
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,993
they make you press a lit cigarette into your arm

474
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:33,157
and have it burn all the way down to the filter

475
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:35,381
without the slightest flinch.

476
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:38,056
Us, Manhattan boys,

477
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:40,728
we jump off cliffs into the Harlem River,

478
00:25:40,763 --> 00:25:45,078
which is literally shitty, because half a million toilets flush into it every day.

479
00:25:45,286 --> 00:25:46,903
Whoo-oo!

480
00:25:48,443 --> 00:25:50,429
Yeah!

481
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:54,422
Oooh!

482
00:25:54,457 --> 00:25:55,704
Yeah!

483
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:57,875
Hey, y'all, I carried the clothes up,

484
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,786
but I ain't carrying them down.

485
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:00,953
Peepee, this is you...

486
00:26:00,988 --> 00:26:03,217
all 33 pounds of you, gone with the wind.

487
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,739
Wow. That's a long way down.

488
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:11,559
Devil's toe is no big deal. We've all done it a million times.

489
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:13,806
I never done it.

490
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:15,584
You never did it?

491
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,936
Pedro, you never do nothing.

492
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:21,773
You know who was awesome on this rock?

493
00:26:21,808 --> 00:26:24,588
Bobby. That kids would do back flips off this rock.

494
00:26:25,993 --> 00:26:26,831
Hey, Mickey.

495
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:29,141
What?

496
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:31,211
Don't talk about him like he's dead.

497
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,232
He's not dead.

498
00:26:36,581 --> 00:26:38,893
There goes the circle line. Check it out.

499
00:26:41,873 --> 00:26:42,638
Whoo!
Full moon!

500
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,835
Whoo!

501
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,140
Hey, yo!

502
00:26:46,192 --> 00:26:47,266
Whoo!

503
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:48,828
Hey, circle this!

504
00:26:52,114 --> 00:26:53,734
Hey, I'm going. Watch out, watch out...

505
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:55,355
I'm going to show you how to do it.

506
00:26:55,695 --> 00:26:58,822
Ye-ea-ah!

507
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:11,675
That was a good jump.

508
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,859
Oh, he's nuts.

509
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:18,026
Hey, I'm going to walk down.

510
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:20,029
What you talking about? You can't walk down.

511
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:21,716
There's no way to walk down.

512
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:22,901
I ain't jumping.

513
00:27:22,936 --> 00:27:25,303
Pedro, your clothes are down there. How you gonna get your clothes?

514
00:27:25,338 --> 00:27:26,965
You going to walk around naked all day?

515
00:27:27,607 --> 00:27:30,122
Pedro, if you don't jump, Mickey's going to tease you so bad...

516
00:27:30,157 --> 00:27:32,637
You might as well just jump and get it over with. Feel better.

517
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:36,092
What the hell, right?

518
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:40,356
Oh...

519
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:41,596
shit...

520
00:27:41,631 --> 00:27:42,766
Pedro!

521
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:43,928
Bad form. Bad form.

522
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:46,747
Oh... My God!

523
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:48,483
Oh, shit. Is he all right?

524
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:50,185
Pedro, you all right?

525
00:27:52,457 --> 00:27:53,690
You ready?

526
00:27:53,725 --> 00:27:54,827
Yeah.

527
00:27:54,862 --> 00:27:56,728
Listen, don't tell the other guys,

528
00:27:56,763 --> 00:27:58,923
but when we leave here, I got a surprise for you.

529
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,572
Tell me what it is.

530
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:03,525
It's a surprise. Trust me, all right? Ouch, don't mess around, man...

531
00:28:04,624 --> 00:28:06,201
Alright, you ready? Come on! You ready?

532
00:28:06,236 --> 00:28:08,771
- Let's jump. - On three. Ready?

533
00:28:08,806 --> 00:28:09,656
Uh-huh.

534
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,300
1,

535
00:28:11,612 --> 00:28:12,822
2,

536
00:28:13,414 --> 00:28:14,483
3.

537
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:28,085
Come on. Let's go.

538
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:32,248
What's up, Manny? How you doing?

539
00:28:32,283 --> 00:28:33,665
Fine. Thank you, sir.

540
00:28:34,415 --> 00:28:35,776
This is my friend Jim.

541
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:36,582
How you doing?

542
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:38,904
I can't believe I hit my head on that rock.

543
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:40,198
It's killing me.

544
00:28:56,674 --> 00:28:58,467
Jim, um, this is Winkie.

545
00:28:58,502 --> 00:29:00,260
- Hi. - How you doing?

546
00:29:00,295 --> 00:29:01,630
Good.

547
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:05,724
And this...

548
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,457
this is Blinkie.

549
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,437
- Hi. - Hi.

550
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:13,221
I lost my heart

551
00:29:13,256 --> 00:29:16,340
Under the bridge

552
00:29:17,368 --> 00:29:18,525
That little girl...

553
00:29:18,735 --> 00:29:20,594
I've seen you play ball, Jim.

554
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,593
You're a very beautiful player.

555
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:26,470
Very zen.

556
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:28,186
And now I moan

557
00:29:28,241 --> 00:29:32,023
And now I holler

558
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:35,051
She'll never know

559
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:39,730
Just what I found

560
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,977
That blue-eyed girl

561
00:29:43,012 --> 00:29:45,862
It'll make you fuck like Superman.

562
00:29:45,897 --> 00:29:46,809
She said no more

563
00:29:48,647 --> 00:29:51,475
Faster than a speeding bullet...

564
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,269
Became blue-eyed whore...

565
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,006
More powerful than a locomotive...

566
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:59,231
Down by the water...

567
00:29:59,648 --> 00:30:02,007
Able to, um...

568
00:30:03,462 --> 00:30:06,604
I can't think of anything with a single bound.

569
00:30:07,217 --> 00:30:11,862
See her again...

570
00:30:21,026 --> 00:30:22,328
Do you have any protection?

571
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:23,364
Yeah.

572
00:30:26,515 --> 00:30:29,961
This one's, uh, ribbed for extra pleasure.

573
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:34,704
So what are you waiting for?

574
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:36,310
What do you mean?

575
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,610
Take off your clothes.

576
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:42,899
Well, uh...

577
00:30:43,947 --> 00:30:45,693
could we shut off the lights first?

578
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:48,516
Little fish, big fish

579
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:50,704
Swimming in the water

580
00:30:50,739 --> 00:30:52,717
Come back here, man

581
00:30:52,752 --> 00:30:54,805
Give me my daughter

582
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,891
Little fish, big fish

583
00:30:56,926 --> 00:30:58,942
Swimming in the water

584
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:03,471
White ship disappears in the wave machine this morning.

585
00:31:04,605 --> 00:31:07,086
Your eyes got shut with secret chains

586
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:10,756
that pillow armies eventually set free...

587
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:15,870
like soft horses through toy deserts.

588
00:31:34,604 --> 00:31:35,868
I love this mansion,

589
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,167
though it's too many windows...

590
00:31:40,436 --> 00:31:42,495
to open halfway each morning...

591
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,318
to close halfway each night.

592
00:33:00,163 --> 00:33:01,509
I looked at his body,

593
00:33:02,168 --> 00:33:04,559
and it was death for the first time.

594
00:33:06,072 --> 00:33:09,129
His face was thin and wrinkled, almost apelike.

595
00:33:10,112 --> 00:33:13,355
His hair, just gray patches on his scalp.

596
00:33:14,183 --> 00:33:17,840
He looked 60 years old, and he was 16.

597
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:21,093
Couldn't believe how skinny he was...

598
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:24,124
much skinnier than he was in the hospital.

599
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:29,468
It was like having the skeleton of someone you knew put right in front of you.

600
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:37,382
I felt dazed, like I'd just come out of a four-hour movie I didn't understand.

601
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,669
I kept thinking about his face...

602
00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:44,583
and death...

603
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,727
what a cheat the whole thing was.

604
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:50,692
Hey, you guys remember that Halloween

605
00:33:50,727 --> 00:33:53,324
when Bobby filled that paper bag with dog shit,

606
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:55,722
lit it on fire and put it outside Father Dunne's door,

607
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:57,481
and we all hid behind the dumpster?

608
00:33:57,516 --> 00:33:58,424
Yeah.

609
00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:00,602
I could picture Father Dunne

610
00:34:00,637 --> 00:34:04,007
comming outside, stepping on that shit. Picture him in the john...

611
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,721
scraping the shit off his shoe like this.

612
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:09,560
You think that'll keep him out of heaven?

613
00:34:09,595 --> 00:34:11,605
Are you kidding? Jesus Christ himself

614
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:14,441
would have laughed at that. It was hilarious!

615
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:16,196
What about the time at the formal

616
00:34:16,231 --> 00:34:17,916
when Bobby got caught in the bathroom

617
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:19,976
with Mary Ann Dugan

618
00:34:20,011 --> 00:34:22,477
and McNulty came in and busted him?

619
00:34:22,512 --> 00:34:24,230
He was, like, "Father, I swear.

620
00:34:24,265 --> 00:34:25,914
We weren't doing anything."

621
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,639
Meanwhile she's got a giant wad of cum

622
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:29,381
hanging off her face.

623
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,539
I tell you, that kid was definitely a pisser.

624
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,241
It was weird seeing him today, man.

625
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:41,086
He was all shriveled up and wrinkled. He looked like my grandfather.

626
00:34:43,224 --> 00:34:44,840
I'll tell you what, though.

627
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,457
That kid was in so much pain,

628
00:34:46,492 --> 00:34:48,624
it's better off he died.

629
00:34:52,213 --> 00:34:53,839
How the hell would you know, Mickey?

630
00:34:56,175 --> 00:34:57,695
Did you go and visit him?

631
00:34:58,651 --> 00:34:59,760
Huh?

632
00:35:01,027 --> 00:35:02,750
Any of you guys go and visit him?

633
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:08,385
All right. Then shut the fuck up.

634
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:12,095
Hey, Jim. Look at my brother's girlfriend in the park.

635
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,327
She's sitting there, eating a sandwich.

636
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:14,896
Next thing you know, she's shot in the head.

637
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:16,732
She's dead. It's over.

638
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:18,317
What about little Teddy Rayhill?

639
00:35:18,352 --> 00:35:20,187
Perfect example.

640
00:35:20,222 --> 00:35:21,807
Remember that night he was up on the roof,

641
00:35:21,842 --> 00:35:25,452
and he was doing poppers, having a great time, laughing his ass off

642
00:35:25,487 --> 00:35:26,676
He started walking backwards...

643
00:35:26,711 --> 00:35:29,924
Boom! He fell right off the goddamn roof.

644
00:35:30,842 --> 00:35:32,231
It was meant to be, right?

645
00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:35,405
Fuck that, you guys!

646
00:35:35,683 --> 00:35:38,593
Bobby was the best fucking guy around, you know that?

647
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:41,823
What are you, a bunch of idiots?

648
00:35:44,988 --> 00:35:46,982
You don't even understand, do you?

649
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:00,694
Jim, you all right?

650
00:36:02,052 --> 00:36:03,352
Huh?

651
00:36:06,215 --> 00:36:09,727
Listen, maybe you should talk to one of the priests.

652
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:13,109
I don't know. Maybe... Maybe they can help you out.

653
00:36:13,144 --> 00:36:14,674
Help me out?

654
00:36:15,496 --> 00:36:18,237
I wouldn't ask one of those cocksuckers for directions.

655
00:36:20,217 --> 00:36:21,663
You know what?

656
00:36:21,698 --> 00:36:24,155
You guys need to lighten the fuck up, all right?

657
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,615
Let bygones be fucking bygones.

658
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,113
Shitty fucking world.

659
00:36:44,598 --> 00:36:47,336
Live life to the fucking fullest. You know what I mean?

660
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:50,594
Shit happens, man.

661
00:36:50,629 --> 00:36:52,155
Shit fucking happens.

662
00:36:56,898 --> 00:36:58,293
Come on. Let's go.

663
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,910
Jim, come on.

664
00:37:01,373 --> 00:37:02,883
You're growing up,

665
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:05,890
and rain sort of remains on the branches of a tree

666
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:07,650
that will someday rule the earth.

667
00:37:09,765 --> 00:37:11,248
And that's good that there's rain.

668
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,167
Clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions.

669
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,437
And it clears the streets of the silent armies

670
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:24,142
so we can dance.

671
00:37:26,391 --> 00:37:28,609
Ted sniffing glue He was 12 years old

672
00:37:28,687 --> 00:37:31,261
Fell from the roof on east 2-9

673
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,799
Cathy was 11 when she pulled the plug

674
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:36,754
26 reds and a bottle of wine

675
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,598
Bobby had leukemia, 14 years old

676
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,378
He looked like 65 when he died

677
00:37:40,413 --> 00:37:41,750
He was a friend of mine

678
00:37:41,785 --> 00:37:46,298
Those are people who died, died

679
00:37:47,176 --> 00:37:48,759
Those are people who died, died

680
00:37:49,511 --> 00:37:51,497
Those are people who died, died

681
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:53,392
They were all my friends

682
00:37:53,427 --> 00:37:54,987
They just died

683
00:37:57,091 --> 00:38:06,914
Those are people who died, died

684
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:12,878
They were all my friends and they died

685
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:26,906
Did I ever tell you about the first time I did heroin?

686
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:36,015
I went down to Pedro's basement.

687
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:39,901
All sorts of characters were in the storage-room shooting gallery.

688
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,887
I was just going to sniff a bag,

689
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:45,282
but a guy says,

690
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:49,753
"If you're going to sniff, might as well pop it,

691
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:54,669
and if you're going to pop it, might as well mainline."

692
00:38:55,844 --> 00:38:56,883
I was scared of needles,

693
00:38:57,404 --> 00:38:59,059
but I gave in.

694
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,454
It was like a long heat wave through my body.

695
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:14,205
Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty feeling was completely flushed out.

696
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:39,685
Look, Ma, I'm not in the mood for your dime-store psychology, all right?

697
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,464
Could you just please leave me alone?

698
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:42,773
I got a little sick, all right?

699
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:44,941
We're not going to live like this, Jim.

700
00:39:44,976 --> 00:39:48,434
We're not going to live like this. I'm warning you! I'm telling you.

701
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,572
Oh, God, Mom.

702
00:39:49,607 --> 00:39:51,346
You're always warning me, aren't you?

703
00:39:51,381 --> 00:39:54,419
Blah, blah, blah. You're always in my fucking ear.

704
00:39:54,454 --> 00:39:57,775
Blah, blah, blah. You don't know anything.

705
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,258
What are you talking about?

706
00:39:59,293 --> 00:40:01,517
Go clean toilets or whatever the hell it is you do.

707
00:40:01,552 --> 00:40:03,345
When you're done, clean this one.

708
00:40:03,887 --> 00:40:05,235
Don't talk like that!

709
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,377
What's the matter with you?

710
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:12,961
Gee whiz, Ma, you know...

711
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:15,900
we got to have these heart-to-heart talks more often.

712
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:17,943
They're really good for us.

713
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:20,082
I don't know you.

714
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:24,872
I don't believe this is you, Jim.

715
00:40:25,986 --> 00:40:28,173
Please, Jim. I don't know who you are.

716
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:31,377
Yeah, I know. I was such a good little boy, right...

717
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:33,489
with such potential, wasn't that it?

718
00:40:33,524 --> 00:40:35,567
Is that what you're going to say?

719
00:40:42,332 --> 00:40:45,364
Oh, Jim. What's happening?

720
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:47,366
Jim, what's happening?

721
00:40:48,962 --> 00:40:51,996
First, it's a Saturday-night thing,

722
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:55,163
and you feel cool, like a gangster or a rock star.

723
00:40:56,028 --> 00:40:58,125
It's just something to kill the boredom, you know?

724
00:40:58,963 --> 00:41:01,539
They call it a chippie, a small habit.

725
00:41:02,388 --> 00:41:05,793
It feels so good, you start doing it on Tuesdays,

726
00:41:05,828 --> 00:41:07,655
then Thursdays.

727
00:41:08,952 --> 00:41:10,313
Then it's got you.

728
00:41:10,923 --> 00:41:12,926
Every wise-ass punk on the block says

729
00:41:12,961 --> 00:41:14,082
it won't happen to them,

730
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,115
but it does.

731
00:41:20,955 --> 00:41:22,172
Go do it!

732
00:41:22,207 --> 00:41:23,615
I ain't doing it. I always do it!

733
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:27,060
I'll do it. I'll do it.

734
00:41:29,666 --> 00:41:33,500
Excuse me, ma'am. Could you tell me the fastest way to the subway?

735
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:38,570
Yeah. That's the "B" train. Go to this corner and make a left.

736
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:39,387
It's right there.

737
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,401
What are you doing? Let go! Let go!

738
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:43,838
Let go of that!

739
00:41:43,966 --> 00:41:46,094
Oh, my God! What? Oh!

740
00:41:47,313 --> 00:41:49,868
- Help! No! No! - What are you doing?

741
00:41:51,003 --> 00:41:52,121
Let's go!

742
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:01,515
Come on!

743
00:42:05,644 --> 00:42:07,118
I don't feel like going in today.

744
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:13,019
Father, is it all right if I don't go in today?

745
00:42:13,332 --> 00:42:15,823
Why? What are you scared of?

746
00:42:16,136 --> 00:42:18,879
Nothing. I just don't feel like it, that's all.

747
00:42:19,192 --> 00:42:24,187
I imagine you have more to confess than anybody here.

748
00:42:24,222 --> 00:42:25,802
Unburden yourself.

749
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,690
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

750
00:42:37,725 --> 00:42:41,796
It's been about four months since my last confession.

751
00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:44,545
Yes, my son?

752
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:48,026
Well, I don't know where to start, Father.

753
00:42:49,861 --> 00:42:52,183
Have you taken the name of Jesus Christ in vain?

754
00:42:52,391 --> 00:42:54,675
Yeah. Yeah, I have.

755
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,738
Have you disrespected your mother and father?

756
00:42:56,773 --> 00:42:58,051
Uh-huh.

757
00:42:58,086 --> 00:43:00,627
Have you stolen or cheated your fellow man?

758
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,475
Yeah, but I'm not proud of it.

759
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,550
Have you had impure thoughts

760
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:08,456
or engaged in impure deeds?

761
00:43:08,491 --> 00:43:10,292
Oh, Father, you have no idea.

762
00:43:10,327 --> 00:43:13,838
Is there something else that you want to tell me in your own words?

763
00:43:15,477 --> 00:43:18,239
I've done all kinds of crazy shit.

764
00:43:18,274 --> 00:43:20,377
Oh, excuse me, Father.

765
00:43:20,586 --> 00:43:21,962
Fuck, I'm s...

766
00:43:22,939 --> 00:43:24,250
Christ, I have a dirty mouth.

767
00:43:24,285 --> 00:43:25,796
Look, I'm... I'm sorry about that.

768
00:43:26,624 --> 00:43:28,058
Will you just go on?

769
00:43:28,788 --> 00:43:29,967
10 Hail Marys,

770
00:43:30,384 --> 00:43:32,631
five Our Fathers.

771
00:43:35,564 --> 00:43:36,712
What do you mean?

772
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:37,826
And that's it?

773
00:43:37,861 --> 00:43:39,216
That's my punishment?

774
00:43:43,657 --> 00:43:45,324
You know something?

775
00:43:46,363 --> 00:43:48,872
My friend Bobby, he was the best,

776
00:43:49,465 --> 00:43:51,115
and he's dead.

777
00:43:53,602 --> 00:43:56,062
This sucks! You know that? This really sucks.

778
00:43:56,726 --> 00:43:58,054
It's not fair, Father.

779
00:44:01,343 --> 00:44:03,107
Your nose is running,

780
00:44:03,142 --> 00:44:04,837
your stomach cramps,

781
00:44:04,872 --> 00:44:07,077
your legs feel like they've played

782
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:09,378
six straight games on top of each other,

783
00:44:10,176 --> 00:44:12,820
and the voice is always there in the back of your head...

784
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:16,665
"Just one more time. then we'll stop."

785
00:44:36,228 --> 00:44:39,275
Quick to the ball. Quick to the ball. Two hands. Good, Ignatius.

786
00:44:39,446 --> 00:44:42,561
Good. Good. Quick to the ball. Two hands. Right behind you.

787
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,304
Sir, all right if I use the bathroom, Coach?

788
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:45,584
Jim, you got a bladder like a woman.

789
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:46,689
Let's go. Again.

790
00:44:47,542 --> 00:44:49,268
There we go. Right behind him.

791
00:44:49,303 --> 00:44:50,193
Right behind him.

792
00:44:50,228 --> 00:44:52,032
Quick to the ball. Two hands. Two hands.

793
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:21,345
Jim?

794
00:45:24,846 --> 00:45:26,245
I thought you were taking a piss.

795
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,482
Oh.

796
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:29,008
What are you doing in here every practice?

797
00:45:35,603 --> 00:45:37,379
Have you been waiting for me, Jim?

798
00:45:38,446 --> 00:45:40,026
Giving me some kind of a signal?

799
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:44,080
What are you talking about, Swifty?

800
00:45:45,278 --> 00:45:46,645
Don't act surprised.

801
00:45:53,923 --> 00:45:55,415
Do we understand each other?

802
00:45:59,532 --> 00:46:01,815
It's not going to happen, Swifty.

803
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,228
Put the money away.

804
00:46:03,437 --> 00:46:04,792
You want more?

805
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:08,152
Here.

806
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:10,765
Just let me do it.

807
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,930
Get the fuck out of my face!

808
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:15,410
Take it easy, Jim.

809
00:46:15,445 --> 00:46:17,431
You can't blame me for trying.

810
00:46:19,427 --> 00:46:20,698
I made a mistake, all right?

811
00:46:21,767 --> 00:46:23,777
Let's just pretend it never happened.

812
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:26,309
Things will go back to exactly how they were before.

813
00:46:26,344 --> 00:46:27,599
Okay?

814
00:46:27,912 --> 00:46:30,791
Okay? Here, keep the money.

815
00:46:31,515 --> 00:46:33,025
Keep the money.

816
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,726
Just don't tell anybody, all right?

817
00:46:38,652 --> 00:46:40,380
Good. Tell anybody you want!

818
00:46:40,415 --> 00:46:43,078
Nobody's going to believe a drughead like you, anyway.

819
00:46:43,113 --> 00:46:45,046
You think we don't know what you've been doing?

820
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:51,237
Give me the fucking money

821
00:46:51,272 --> 00:46:52,524
and get the fuck out of here.

822
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,629
Get the fuck... Get the fuck out here!

823
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:56,537
Come on! Get out of here!

824
00:47:03,938 --> 00:47:05,988
And you want to stop. You really do.

825
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,914
But it's like a dream.

826
00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:09,770
You can't stop dreams.

827
00:47:09,805 --> 00:47:12,709
They move in crazy pieces, any way they want to,

828
00:47:12,744 --> 00:47:16,514
and suddenly, you're capable of anything.

829
00:47:57,453 --> 00:47:58,818
Ha ha ha!

830
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:23,460
No!

831
00:48:38,786 --> 00:48:41,829
Wake up, Mr. Carroll! It's later than you think.

832
00:49:02,974 --> 00:49:04,104
Oh. All right!

833
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,047
- I need a lift. - All right.

834
00:49:07,082 --> 00:49:08,245
What do you got?

835
00:49:09,145 --> 00:49:11,500
Three different pills. Which are the ups?

836
00:49:12,568 --> 00:49:14,555
I never asked. I thought one of youse would know.

837
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:15,610
Oh, great.

838
00:49:15,645 --> 00:49:17,721
We look like pharmacists?

839
00:49:17,756 --> 00:49:19,798
I don't know what to take.

840
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:20,906
What do we take?

841
00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:21,795
Let me see.

842
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:23,677
The blacks and the reds are the ups.

843
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:27,729
I think the pink ones are the ups.

844
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:28,757
Why?

845
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:31,377
'Cuz I associate pink with lightness, you know?

846
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:34,964
The black ones seem like they'd knock you on your ass.

847
00:49:34,999 --> 00:49:36,761
They might be faded seconals.

848
00:49:37,713 --> 00:49:38,922
No, they're not faded.

849
00:49:38,957 --> 00:49:40,383
They'd be sticky. They're not.

850
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:42,513
That's bullshit.

851
00:49:42,548 --> 00:49:44,424
- Fuck your mother. - My what?

852
00:49:45,404 --> 00:49:46,724
All right! Calm down.

853
00:49:46,759 --> 00:49:48,589
Don't ever talk about my mother.

854
00:49:48,624 --> 00:49:50,967
Don't ever hit me like that again.

855
00:49:51,002 --> 00:49:53,311
Come on! Alright! Give me your hat.

856
00:49:53,346 --> 00:49:54,551
We got a game to play, alright?

857
00:49:54,586 --> 00:49:56,162
Just give me something.

858
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,184
Hi, Neutron.

859
00:49:58,219 --> 00:49:59,419
Let me ask him.

860
00:50:00,086 --> 00:50:02,152
Neutron, you know which ones are the ups?

861
00:50:04,231 --> 00:50:07,021
I think you should put that shit away before Swifty comes in here.

862
00:50:07,828 --> 00:50:09,820
Why you acting like such a square ass?

863
00:50:09,855 --> 00:50:11,458
Screw you, Mickey.

864
00:50:11,493 --> 00:50:14,822
Screw you, too, Tough guy. Man.

865
00:50:14,857 --> 00:50:18,151
I'm just going to take the black.

866
00:50:18,726 --> 00:50:19,833
You sure?

867
00:50:19,868 --> 00:50:21,765
Mm-hmm. You got a better idea?

868
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,007
Nope. Your guess is as good as mine, Jimbo.

869
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:29,753
It's on today. 50 rebounds.

870
00:50:30,343 --> 00:50:31,940
Good.

871
00:50:31,975 --> 00:50:33,599
Come on. Let's go.

872
00:50:33,634 --> 00:50:36,335
I'm your friend now, right?

873
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,937
What, I got to smack you again, c'mon!

874
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:44,909
Yeah, take your little rat with you.

875
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,122
- What's up, man? - Hey, what's up?

876
00:50:48,157 --> 00:50:49,479
Why are you acting like that?

877
00:50:49,514 --> 00:50:51,364
You know what's wrong.

878
00:50:51,399 --> 00:50:54,050
Used to be about getting high and playing basketball.

879
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:55,516
Now it's just about getting high with you.

880
00:50:55,551 --> 00:50:56,956
You're blowing it, Jim.

881
00:50:56,959 --> 00:50:59,110
Oh, come on. I don't need to hear this from you, Neutron.

882
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:03,448
Yeah, you do, Jim! Listen, no, Jim! I'm really proud of you, man.

883
00:51:03,483 --> 00:51:05,800
Everything's cool. You look great.

884
00:51:05,835 --> 00:51:07,793
I'll see you in the NBA.

885
00:51:45,479 --> 00:51:47,378
Riders on the storm

886
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,302
Riders on the storm

887
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,894
Into this house we're born

888
00:51:58,777 --> 00:52:01,657
Into this world we're thrown

889
00:52:03,393 --> 00:52:05,612
Like a dog without a bone

890
00:52:05,647 --> 00:52:08,408
In fact we're all alone

891
00:52:08,443 --> 00:52:11,170
Riders on the storm

892
00:52:12,709 --> 00:52:15,567
There's a killer on the road

893
00:52:17,207 --> 00:52:20,422
His brain is squirming like a toad

894
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:25,750
Take a long holiday

895
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:29,904
Let your children play

896
00:52:31,676 --> 00:52:34,152
If you give this man a ride

897
00:52:34,187 --> 00:52:36,930
Sweet family will die

898
00:52:36,965 --> 00:52:39,673
Killer on the road

899
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:41,494
Yeah

900
00:53:10,531 --> 00:53:11,559
Did you find it?

901
00:53:11,594 --> 00:53:13,655
No, Father. It's clean. There's no drugs in there.

902
00:53:14,644 --> 00:53:15,629
Thank you, Officer.

903
00:53:15,664 --> 00:53:17,378
I told you we didn't have nothing.

904
00:53:24,926 --> 00:53:28,340
You boys think you're awfully smart, don't you?

905
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:31,737
Well, you're both suspended for a week!

906
00:53:31,772 --> 00:53:33,756
Ooh...

907
00:53:33,825 --> 00:53:36,212
And you'll never play basketball here again.

908
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:37,578
That you can count on.

909
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:40,458
You can't kick me off the team, Swifty.

910
00:53:40,493 --> 00:53:43,226
Oh? Why is that?

911
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,160
'Cause I quit the team...

912
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,276
and the school and this whole faggot-ass scene, that's why.

913
00:53:54,243 --> 00:53:56,184
I could second that motion.

914
00:53:56,219 --> 00:53:58,125
Your resignations are accepted!

915
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:02,909
Neutron, you coming with us?

916
00:54:03,609 --> 00:54:05,013
Huh?

917
00:54:06,784 --> 00:54:08,196
Yeah. That's what I figured.

918
00:54:08,231 --> 00:54:10,372
Come on, man. I'm fucking out of here.

919
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,856
Don't worry, Swifty. I'm not going to rat you out.

920
00:54:20,992 --> 00:54:23,139
And in the next life, Father,

921
00:54:23,174 --> 00:54:25,286
I'm going to have the paddle!

922
00:54:25,321 --> 00:54:26,785
Get out!

923
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,893
Thanks a lot, Neutron.

924
00:54:29,928 --> 00:54:31,373
Thanks, man.

925
00:54:45,142 --> 00:54:47,665
I can't believe this, you know?

926
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,153
I know. What happened to the pills?

927
00:54:50,188 --> 00:54:52,816
We got kicked out of the school, Mickey.

928
00:54:52,851 --> 00:54:55,065
Who cares, man? We lost the pills. The cops took them...

929
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,349
We can't play ball anymore.

930
00:54:59,514 --> 00:55:01,550
Jim, who cares about school, man?

931
00:55:01,585 --> 00:55:04,510
We just lost $40 worth of pharmaceuticals.

932
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,596
I know what happened to them, too.

933
00:55:07,631 --> 00:55:09,432
The cops, they take that all the time.

934
00:55:09,954 --> 00:55:12,243
They either pop them themselves

935
00:55:12,278 --> 00:55:13,398
or they sell them.

936
00:55:13,433 --> 00:55:15,650
What's my mom going to say, man? When I go home?

937
00:55:16,544 --> 00:55:18,089
She ain't gonna say nothing.

938
00:55:18,124 --> 00:55:20,707
You just tell her you're going to school every day in the morning.

939
00:55:20,742 --> 00:55:22,834
Let's get out of here, man...

940
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,444
Go get into something.

941
00:55:28,862 --> 00:55:31,743
You never sold any pills at the schoolyard?

942
00:55:31,778 --> 00:55:32,946
No.

943
00:55:33,155 --> 00:55:36,959
So it's all a big conspiracy against you. Right, Jim?

944
00:55:36,994 --> 00:55:38,759
Yeah. Maybe it is.

945
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,525
Maybe it's not.

946
00:55:41,143 --> 00:55:42,954
You been missing these?

947
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:46,008
What are you going to tell me... they're vitamins?

948
00:55:47,588 --> 00:55:49,221
Oh, fuck you, Ma.

949
00:55:49,256 --> 00:55:50,357
What?!

950
00:55:51,011 --> 00:55:52,691
Get out of my house!

951
00:55:52,726 --> 00:55:54,607
Oh, is that what you want, Ma?

952
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:57,950
Get out! You don't talk to me that way!

953
00:55:57,985 --> 00:56:00,300
If that's what you want, I'm fucking out of here. All right?

954
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:02,799
What are you doing?

955
00:56:02,834 --> 00:56:04,611
I'm leaving! What do you think?

956
00:56:04,646 --> 00:56:07,224
I want you to take all your shit! I'll help you. Here!

957
00:56:09,051 --> 00:56:10,018
You want me to leave?

958
00:56:10,053 --> 00:56:10,737
Yes. Get out!

959
00:56:10,772 --> 00:56:12,872
I'm out of here. Get the fuck out of my way!

960
00:56:12,907 --> 00:56:15,443
This garbage is going to kill you, Jim!

961
00:56:15,478 --> 00:56:16,663
I'm gone!

962
00:56:16,698 --> 00:56:18,271
Gonna to kill you!

963
00:56:23,122 --> 00:56:26,689
Don't you understand? I can't watch you kill yourself?

964
00:56:26,724 --> 00:56:30,256
Ma, you're never going to fucking see me again, alright?

965
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:31,587
Just remember that.

966
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:34,382
Don't say that, Jim. Don't say that!

967
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:37,489
It was a dream, not a nightmare...

968
00:56:38,856 --> 00:56:40,829
a beautiful dream I could never imagine

969
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:42,559
in a thousand nods.

970
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:45,563
I saw this girl next to me

971
00:56:45,598 --> 00:56:48,708
who wasn't beautiful until she smiled,

972
00:56:50,269 --> 00:56:52,209
and I felt that smile come at me

973
00:56:52,244 --> 00:56:53,783
and heat waves following,

974
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,821
soaking through my body and out my fingertips

975
00:56:57,856 --> 00:56:59,505
in shafts of color.

976
00:57:00,804 --> 00:57:02,257
And I knew somewhere in the world...

977
00:57:03,192 --> 00:57:05,418
somewhere... that there was love for me.

978
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:29,601
We just got to raise enough cash

979
00:57:29,636 --> 00:57:31,000
to keep our heads straight.

980
00:57:35,459 --> 00:57:37,689
Luckily, finding money in New York

981
00:57:37,724 --> 00:57:40,904
is like getting laid at the prom... easy.

982
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:53,294
- Fuck it, Pedro! - What's the matter with you?

983
00:57:53,329 --> 00:57:56,680
Jesus! Watch the road. You could kill us all, c'mon!

984
00:57:56,715 --> 00:57:58,752
I get 1,500 bucks for this car.

985
00:57:58,787 --> 00:58:00,394
If it's whacked up, it's worth nothing.

986
00:58:00,429 --> 00:58:02,641
We should buy shit in bulk, man

987
00:58:02,676 --> 00:58:04,699
We'll put it on the street and make real money.

988
00:58:04,801 --> 00:58:06,175
That's 500 bucks a piece.

989
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,344
We'll be on for days, nights, weeks.

990
00:58:08,379 --> 00:58:10,768
Yeah, man. I'd love to go to Puerto Rico,

991
00:58:10,803 --> 00:58:13,386
soak up some rays, you know?

992
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:14,750
See my bitch?

993
00:58:14,785 --> 00:58:16,830
That's what I'd like to do.

994
00:58:16,865 --> 00:58:18,522
- What are you talking about? - What bitch?

995
00:58:18,557 --> 00:58:20,288
We haven't seen a picture or nothing.

996
00:58:20,323 --> 00:58:22,011
She's 500 pounds, Jim.

997
00:58:22,046 --> 00:58:23,993
She got a mustache thicker than her father.

998
00:58:24,028 --> 00:58:26,953
No. That's your mother, Mickey.

999
00:58:26,988 --> 00:58:29,447
She does not exist. Don't fool yourself.

1000
00:58:29,482 --> 00:58:31,576
Be careful. I'm about to whack.

1001
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,788
Oh, shit, man.

1002
00:58:41,035 --> 00:58:43,196
My brother's going to take care of us and this car.

1003
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:48,756
Pedro, wake the fuck up!

1004
00:58:49,557 --> 00:58:50,642
Pedro, come on, man!

1005
00:58:50,677 --> 00:58:53,145
You're going to get us killed, what are you doing?

1006
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,151
I got it, man.

1007
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:56,018
You want me to drive?

1008
00:58:56,053 --> 00:58:58,583
Mickey, you better drive the car. I'm serious, man.

1009
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,908
Just don't blow my high. If there's a scratch in the car, my brother'll kill me.

1010
00:59:32,842 --> 00:59:34,005
Yo, get out of the booth!

1011
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:38,557
Get out the booth, huh?

1012
00:59:39,438 --> 00:59:40,566
Get out.

1013
00:59:41,535 --> 00:59:42,852
Fucking...

1014
00:59:43,582 --> 00:59:44,342
What's up? What's up?

1015
00:59:44,377 --> 00:59:46,263
Come on, I'm in a hurry. Where's the car?

1016
00:59:46,298 --> 00:59:48,149
It's good to see you, too. It's over here.

1017
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,897
It's nice. It's smokin'.

1018
00:59:50,932 --> 00:59:52,105
You tell me that?

1019
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,330
It's everything you wanted.

1020
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:55,500
Get your hands off. You guys look like shit.

1021
00:59:55,535 --> 00:59:58,232
Oh, my God.

1022
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,593
They're taking the car.

1023
01:00:00,628 --> 01:00:02,098
Show me the sign, man!

1024
01:00:02,133 --> 01:00:03,819
Show me the freaking sign!

1025
01:00:03,854 --> 01:00:05,508
It's right there. You see?

1026
01:00:05,543 --> 01:00:07,163
It says "tow-away." Huh?

1027
01:00:08,051 --> 01:00:09,467
You scumbags even read?

1028
01:00:09,502 --> 01:00:11,076
I should kick all your punk asses!

1029
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:12,481
Goddamn it!

1030
01:00:12,516 --> 01:00:13,440
I can get you another car tonight.

1031
01:00:13,475 --> 01:00:15,940
Yeah? John Halligan is waiting for this car.

1032
01:00:15,975 --> 01:00:17,457
I got him out of bed with his wife.

1033
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:18,895
You know how this makes me fucking look?

1034
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:19,884
Kenny, get off.

1035
01:00:23,605 --> 01:00:25,312
You're too stupid to be my brother!

1036
01:00:26,137 --> 01:00:27,063
You're too stupid!

1037
01:00:27,993 --> 01:00:29,331
You want a piece of me, Carroll?

1038
01:00:29,366 --> 01:00:31,297
Back off! Back off!

1039
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:34,331
- Kenny, no more! - Mr. Tough Guy.

1040
01:00:35,005 --> 01:00:37,407
- Kenny, no more! - Huh? Tough guy?

1041
01:00:46,959 --> 01:00:48,020
Give me a sip of your soda.

1042
01:00:57,799 --> 01:00:59,821
You wipe off the bottle before you take a sip?

1043
01:01:00,134 --> 01:01:02,921
You don't even think twice about sharing works with Mickey.

1044
01:01:03,968 --> 01:01:05,581
You think you'll catch something from the bottle

1045
01:01:05,616 --> 01:01:07,118
you're not catch from a needle?

1046
01:01:07,387 --> 01:01:09,765
You mistake me for somebody who gives a shit.

1047
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:13,461
Headquarters... home on and off

1048
01:01:13,496 --> 01:01:15,417
to every down-and-out junkie and wino

1049
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:17,902
from 14th Street to the Bowery.

1050
01:01:18,687 --> 01:01:20,637
It's like a fucking all-star team.

1051
01:01:20,672 --> 01:01:22,104
Jimmy, the other day,

1052
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:23,818
my mother's been ragging on me,

1053
01:01:23,853 --> 01:01:25,802
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

1054
01:01:25,837 --> 01:01:28,224
"You've tried every other way. Go to church.

1055
01:01:28,259 --> 01:01:29,887
Put yourself in Christ's hands."

1056
01:01:29,922 --> 01:01:33,027
So I do it, man. I figure, give it a shot.

1057
01:01:33,062 --> 01:01:34,031
I dig Jesus.

1058
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:37,328
So, I go, man. High mass... a choir and everything.

1059
01:01:37,363 --> 01:01:40,591
The first thing I see on the right, the side altar,

1060
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:43,554
are those little candles in the red glass

1061
01:01:43,589 --> 01:01:46,483
that we used when it was windy in the park

1062
01:01:46,518 --> 01:01:47,504
to cook up.

1063
01:01:48,091 --> 01:01:51,080
And then, this altar boy, he's coming down the aisle

1064
01:01:51,115 --> 01:01:53,202
with this 6-foot candle.

1065
01:01:53,237 --> 01:01:56,904
I envision this huge spoon above it, man,

1066
01:01:56,939 --> 01:02:00,060
with, like, shopping bags full of dope inside of it.

1067
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:02,239
And then the kicker comes, man.

1068
01:02:02,274 --> 01:02:04,944
The priest, he starts doing the thing with the incense.

1069
01:02:04,979 --> 01:02:06,848
You know, starts wafting out.

1070
01:02:06,883 --> 01:02:09,034
I'm in the back. It finally hits me.

1071
01:02:09,069 --> 01:02:11,185
"Where do I know this smell from, man?

1072
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,352
My room, man."

1073
01:02:13,387 --> 01:02:15,703
It's the smell exactly

1074
01:02:15,738 --> 01:02:19,025
of really primo dope cooking up.

1075
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,496
Yeah?

1076
01:02:20,531 --> 01:02:23,523
Exactly the same.

1077
01:02:23,558 --> 01:02:25,418
So what happened next?

1078
01:02:25,453 --> 01:02:27,278
At that point, I split.

1079
01:02:27,313 --> 01:02:28,550
I went home,

1080
01:02:29,873 --> 01:02:32,448
I went inside my closet,

1081
01:02:32,483 --> 01:02:35,553
I got my stash out of the inside pocket

1082
01:02:35,588 --> 01:02:38,482
of my sharkskin easter suit,

1083
01:02:39,221 --> 01:02:42,454
and I got stoned.

1084
01:02:42,489 --> 01:02:44,183
Ba bing...

1085
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,877
ba bang.

1086
01:02:48,153 --> 01:02:50,103
I love a ritual.

1087
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:55,010
Oh, Mary, if you can hear me...

1088
01:02:57,034 --> 01:03:01,903
I need you to fill Jim's heart with love

1089
01:03:01,938 --> 01:03:05,325
because he really needs it now.

1090
01:03:10,061 --> 01:03:11,626
Oh, God...

1091
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:16,203
please watch over my son.

1092
01:03:17,868 --> 01:03:20,333
He needs you now.

1093
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,785
Just take care of him, okay?

1094
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:27,750
I'll be okay.

1095
01:03:37,955 --> 01:03:40,197
I love you, Jim.

1096
01:03:40,232 --> 01:03:42,699
I love you.

1097
01:03:44,406 --> 01:03:47,763
Hey, you holding? You straight, man?

1098
01:03:47,798 --> 01:03:49,476
Get out of here.

1099
01:03:49,511 --> 01:03:50,101
Come on.

1100
01:03:50,136 --> 01:03:51,582
No.

1101
01:04:03,384 --> 01:04:05,182
Hey, have you seen Falco?

1102
01:04:05,495 --> 01:04:08,484
Come on, man. Are you holding anything?

1103
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:11,167
Hey, Diane... Come here, Diane.

1104
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,827
- I'll take care of you, babe. - Yeah?

1105
01:04:14,133 --> 01:04:17,665
Yeah. How about some of this? Ha ha!

1106
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:21,655
I wouldn't do you for a bag, you fucking piece of shit.

1107
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:37,474
Jim.

1108
01:04:37,509 --> 01:04:39,211
Jimmy.

1109
01:04:41,646 --> 01:04:43,835
You're looking good.

1110
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:46,024
Who's your embalmer?

1111
01:04:47,448 --> 01:04:49,735
I want some of what you got.

1112
01:05:21,737 --> 01:05:23,122
Shh.

1113
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:34,133
Check everything in this place.

1114
01:05:34,168 --> 01:05:38,355
Wow. I always wanted to use these syrup pumps.

1115
01:05:42,107 --> 01:05:44,106
And these professional ice-cream scoopers.

1116
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:54,773
Oh, my God.

1117
01:06:12,495 --> 01:06:13,981
Don't make me do it!

1118
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:15,890
I'll do it! I swear to God!

1119
01:06:23,023 --> 01:06:23,826
Jim, watch out.

1120
01:06:28,104 --> 01:06:29,905
Come on!

1121
01:06:32,449 --> 01:06:33,413
It's not opening.

1122
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,318
They don't make them like this anymore.

1123
01:06:35,353 --> 01:06:37,423
You got to get it from the side.

1124
01:06:38,049 --> 01:06:39,172
I got it!

1125
01:06:39,207 --> 01:06:40,296
Oh, cool.

1126
01:06:40,846 --> 01:06:42,355
Change!

1127
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:43,865
Shit!

1128
01:06:44,464 --> 01:06:45,715
Let's get out of here.

1129
01:06:46,443 --> 01:06:48,093
It's locked. We got to go out the back.

1130
01:06:48,128 --> 01:06:49,715
Pedro, let's get out of here!

1131
01:06:51,217 --> 01:06:53,175
What am I, hallucinating here?

1132
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:55,087
Pedro, you'll get us caught.

1133
01:06:55,122 --> 01:06:56,964
The cops are going to come.

1134
01:07:00,274 --> 01:07:02,695
Oh, you want to be tough, huh?

1135
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:06,564
Go ahead... take another sip so I can blow your fucking head all over the counter!

1136
01:07:06,844 --> 01:07:08,830
Go ahead, Pedro! Go ahead!

1137
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,031
Come on, guys! Let's go.

1138
01:07:11,066 --> 01:07:13,447
Put that gun away!

1139
01:07:13,482 --> 01:07:14,795
Don't fuck with me, motherfucker!

1140
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,733
What the hell are you doing, Mickey?

1141
01:07:16,768 --> 01:07:18,452
What the hell did you do that for?

1142
01:07:18,487 --> 01:07:20,137
Let that little spic rot, man!

1143
01:07:20,172 --> 01:07:21,134
He'll get us caught.

1144
01:07:21,169 --> 01:07:23,797
Jim, the cops are coming. Come on!

1145
01:07:24,575 --> 01:07:25,663
Jim!

1146
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:28,916
Jim!

1147
01:07:29,866 --> 01:07:31,078
Pedro! Pedro!

1148
01:07:36,909 --> 01:07:38,299
Jim!

1149
01:07:40,683 --> 01:07:41,913
Freeze! Freeze!

1150
01:07:41,948 --> 01:07:44,170
On your stomach! On your stomach!

1151
01:07:44,205 --> 01:07:46,920
I didn't do anything, I'm telling you!

1152
01:08:21,372 --> 01:08:23,040
This is it, man.

1153
01:08:23,075 --> 01:08:25,635
That Jew got to keep the money under his pillow.

1154
01:08:28,382 --> 01:08:30,667
Hey, Jim, I know you're still mad about Pedro.

1155
01:08:30,702 --> 01:08:32,160
I couldn't do nothing, man.

1156
01:08:32,195 --> 01:08:33,619
He was going to get us caught.

1157
01:08:34,036 --> 01:08:36,217
Definitely shouldn't have went that far.

1158
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:39,657
What happened to you? Your mother kick your ass?

1159
01:08:41,138 --> 01:08:42,393
Yeah, real funny.

1160
01:08:42,428 --> 01:08:44,594
Bring us a couple of Cokes, will you?

1161
01:08:46,557 --> 01:08:47,366
You all right?

1162
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:50,419
Hey, bartender, move out of the way.

1163
01:08:50,732 --> 01:08:53,665
Jim, I'm getting sick. I got to get some money to cop.

1164
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:58,508
Jim.

1165
01:08:58,821 --> 01:09:00,302
You with me here?

1166
01:09:02,926 --> 01:09:04,561
What the hell are you wa...

1167
01:09:04,931 --> 01:09:06,442
Oh, shit.

1168
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:08,515
That's Neutron.

1169
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:11,129
That's the all-American high school game?

1170
01:09:12,389 --> 01:09:14,074
We could have played in that game.

1171
01:09:15,981 --> 01:09:17,357
Who gives a shit? Come on.

1172
01:09:17,392 --> 01:09:19,811
I'm waiting to hear back on a scholarship from Saint John's...

1173
01:09:19,813 --> 01:09:21,484
I'm not sure about it, but hopefully it will work out.

1174
01:09:21,607 --> 01:09:24,172
Jim, I'm starting to jones. Gotta get out there. We need some money.

1175
01:09:25,004 --> 01:09:27,051
Jim, don't dwell on these dreams, man.

1176
01:09:27,351 --> 01:09:28,687
Will you come on?

1177
01:09:31,183 --> 01:09:34,411
Meet you outside, man. I'm getting sick.

1178
01:09:34,725 --> 01:09:36,351
You want to meet me out there?

1179
01:09:36,386 --> 01:09:37,977
Is it okay if I say hi to my mom?

1180
01:09:38,809 --> 01:09:39,918
Hi, Mom.

1181
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:42,431
- Thanks. - Thanks a lot.

1182
01:09:44,232 --> 01:09:52,444
You don't know it, but you're coming right along

1183
01:09:55,453 --> 01:10:02,884
Please be strong

1184
01:10:02,919 --> 01:10:11,719
You don't know it, but you're coming right along

1185
01:10:19,184 --> 01:10:21,434
Hey, you! Stop! You can't go in there! Stop!

1186
01:10:33,397 --> 01:10:34,598
What do you want?

1187
01:10:34,633 --> 01:10:36,283
You realize what time it is?

1188
01:10:36,318 --> 01:10:38,626
Yeah. Um... is Winkie and Blinkie here?

1189
01:10:38,661 --> 01:10:40,519
Who the hell are Winkie and Blinkie?

1190
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:41,100
Hey, guys.

1191
01:10:41,268 --> 01:10:44,318
Lisa, Mel, you know this boy?

1192
01:10:44,332 --> 01:10:46,179
No, Daddy.

1193
01:10:46,586 --> 01:10:47,207
Come on.

1194
01:10:47,507 --> 01:10:49,243
All right.

1195
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:51,386
Come on. Get out of here.

1196
01:10:51,468 --> 01:10:54,651
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin. He got past me. - Don't let it happen again.

1197
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:56,531
It won't happen again. Get out of here!

1198
01:10:59,711 --> 01:11:01,995
What? What?

1199
01:11:03,461 --> 01:11:04,563
Asshole.

1200
01:11:04,863 --> 01:11:07,537
Hey, fuck-up, get fucking up, man!

1201
01:11:07,893 --> 01:11:09,745
- What's your problem, man? - What's YOUR problem, man?

1202
01:11:10,045 --> 01:11:11,351
You sold my girlfriend some shit the other day.

1203
01:11:11,651 --> 01:11:13,137
You almost killed her. What was it... rat poison?

1204
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:15,424
It's not my fault your girl can't handle her drugs.

1205
01:11:15,724 --> 01:11:18,021
I want my fucking $20 back, man.

1206
01:11:18,321 --> 01:11:21,408
Look, there's no money-back guarantees. I'm not selling refrigerators here.

1207
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:23,079
Oh, yeah?

1208
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:25,455
I'll cut you a dynamite deal on mexican shit.

1209
01:11:25,755 --> 01:11:28,209
Give me my $20, or we'll go outside.

1210
01:11:28,509 --> 01:11:31,505
If we go outside, one of us is going to get hurt.

1211
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,780
I told you one of us would get hurt.

1212
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,940
Is that right?

1213
01:11:52,328 --> 01:11:55,952
It's been hard... the writing... lately.

1214
01:11:56,416 --> 01:12:01,844
Terrible numbness, then suddenly it comes...

1215
01:12:02,144 --> 01:12:06,730
in beautiful fragments or terrible dreams...

1216
01:12:07,107 --> 01:12:09,362
like nods...

1217
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:12,725
so high.

1218
01:13:15,635 --> 01:13:18,075
Uh!

1219
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:28,832
Reggie, is that you?

1220
01:13:29,132 --> 01:13:32,052
Who the fuck do you think it is?

1221
01:13:35,017 --> 01:13:37,331
Ohh...

1222
01:13:40,364 --> 01:13:42,261
Don't worry,

1223
01:13:42,561 --> 01:13:45,495
you're not dead yet.

1224
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:01,353
It's not bad.

1225
01:14:02,455 --> 01:14:04,765
Hey, give me that.

1226
01:14:12,494 --> 01:14:14,792
How come it's all wet?

1227
01:14:18,691 --> 01:14:21,430
I didn't say you could read this.

1228
01:14:21,469 --> 01:14:24,602
What, have you been digging through all my stuff?

1229
01:14:30,542 --> 01:14:34,418
I need... I got to get out of here.

1230
01:14:34,485 --> 01:14:35,200
Where's my jacket?

1231
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,913
You're welcome.

1232
01:14:42,364 --> 01:14:45,103
What the hell am I thanking you for?

1233
01:14:45,403 --> 01:14:49,875
Because you was frozen in the snow like a goddamn creamsicle.

1234
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:06,860
Where is it?

1235
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,521
What?

1236
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:14,074
You know what the fuck I'm talking about, Reggie! Where is it?

1237
01:15:16,837 --> 01:15:19,644
You mean this?

1238
01:15:20,879 --> 01:15:23,631
Huh?

1239
01:15:24,456 --> 01:15:27,097
Give it to me.

1240
01:15:28,963 --> 01:15:32,469
I'll cut your fucking throat, Reggie! Give it to me, all right?

1241
01:15:32,769 --> 01:15:35,087
Just give it to me!

1242
01:15:44,033 --> 01:15:45,511
Oh, give it to me!

1243
01:15:45,811 --> 01:15:47,670
Give it to me! I'm serious!

1244
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:49,547
Give me it!

1245
01:15:49,847 --> 01:15:51,855
Give it to me!

1246
01:15:52,155 --> 01:15:54,721
Goddamn it!

1247
01:16:00,747 --> 01:16:02,448
I'll make you an incredible offer.

1248
01:16:02,748 --> 01:16:06,275
I'm going to save your life twice in one day, understand me?

1249
01:16:08,311 --> 01:16:12,433
You should have left me in the fucking snow, man.

1250
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:16,759
Give me the money for my dope, too.

1251
01:16:17,936 --> 01:16:20,370
I'm not gonna suck your dick, all right? Put that away.

1252
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:21,900
Who the hell wants you to suck their dick?

1253
01:16:23,268 --> 01:16:23,843
Goddamn it!

1254
01:16:24,143 --> 01:16:27,730
Look at yourself! Just look at yourself.

1255
01:16:39,663 --> 01:16:41,510
Oh, Reggie...

1256
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:42,869
it's okay.

1257
01:16:43,169 --> 01:16:44,775
Why are you doing this?

1258
01:16:45,075 --> 01:16:50,774
Because once upon a time, somebody helped me, and I always pay what I owe.

1259
01:16:56,048 --> 01:16:57,755
Reggie.

1260
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,992
Reggie, I just need a taste.

1261
01:17:03,012 --> 01:17:06,165
I just need a little something, Reggie.

1262
01:17:08,152 --> 01:17:08,992
You don't understand.

1263
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:11,397
It hurts, Reggie!

1264
01:17:13,945 --> 01:17:15,269
Ow!

1265
01:17:19,245 --> 01:17:21,363
Reggie, I got to go.

1266
01:17:22,044 --> 01:17:23,824
I got to go see my mom.

1267
01:17:25,009 --> 01:17:26,429
You got to let me get out of here, Reggie.

1268
01:17:28,035 --> 01:17:29,392
Reggie!

1269
01:17:30,754 --> 01:17:33,666
It hur... It hurts.

1270
01:17:36,337 --> 01:17:38,892
Aah! Shit!

1271
01:17:42,232 --> 01:17:44,094
Oh, boy...

1272
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:52,925
Touch the taste and taste the smell

1273
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,579
Smell the scent, all the gifts you gave to me, baby

1274
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:03,489
The food of your brain

1275
01:18:03,524 --> 01:18:07,270
The room is spinning round

1276
01:18:07,305 --> 01:18:09,953
I never come down

1277
01:18:17,752 --> 01:18:20,105
The room is spinning round

1278
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:25,467
I never come down...

1279
01:18:31,768 --> 01:18:32,643
Reggie.

1280
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,417
you got to give me it.

1281
01:18:35,452 --> 01:18:37,905
You got to give me it, Reggie.

1282
01:18:39,033 --> 01:18:40,838
Please! Oh!

1283
01:18:41,576 --> 01:18:43,301
Reggie, come on!

1284
01:18:58,867 --> 01:19:04,426
I remember you, too

1285
01:19:06,372 --> 01:19:09,238
I blew my mind

1286
01:19:10,073 --> 01:19:12,632
Wake up. Can't sleep all day.

1287
01:19:14,935 --> 01:19:16,741
Oh. Thanks.

1288
01:19:29,103 --> 01:19:30,370
Jesus Christ.

1289
01:19:31,292 --> 01:19:32,583
What happened to you?

1290
01:19:32,618 --> 01:19:34,906
What does it look like? Motherfucker shot me.

1291
01:19:35,901 --> 01:19:37,095
Woke my black ass up.

1292
01:19:38,794 --> 01:19:40,071
Shit.

1293
01:19:40,106 --> 01:19:42,568
Look, uh... I'll be back in the morning, Jim.

1294
01:19:42,603 --> 01:19:44,178
You just stay cool.

1295
01:19:44,213 --> 01:19:45,638
You start to get panicky,

1296
01:19:45,673 --> 01:19:48,438
write about me in that book of yours.

1297
01:19:48,473 --> 01:19:50,743
Actually, I was a little hurt I wasn't mentioned.

1298
01:19:52,874 --> 01:19:54,877
You really like my writing, huh, Reggie?

1299
01:19:54,912 --> 01:19:56,845
Damn, man, I told you four times already.

1300
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,588
What do you want me to do? Bend over and kiss your ass?

1301
01:20:05,272 --> 01:20:07,752
Hey, Reg, do me a favor.

1302
01:20:07,787 --> 01:20:09,896
While you're out, pick me up a bag.

1303
01:20:19,431 --> 01:20:21,844
The room is spinning round

1304
01:20:22,887 --> 01:20:27,107
I may never come down

1305
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:08,940
I am alone.

1306
01:21:12,329 --> 01:21:13,570
Not just me.

1307
01:21:14,867 --> 01:21:15,990
We're alone...

1308
01:21:17,319 --> 01:21:19,237
alone forever.

1309
01:21:21,487 --> 01:21:24,170
And who's at the end of that forever tunnel I run through,

1310
01:21:24,648 --> 01:21:27,378
up Fifth with the wallpaper of skyscrapers?

1311
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:37,926
I'm thinking, after all those beautiful trips,

1312
01:21:40,458 --> 01:21:42,404
that this is one of those bad ones.

1313
01:21:44,661 --> 01:21:45,828
Diane?

1314
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:48,361
Hey!

1315
01:21:50,903 --> 01:21:52,865
Jim. Remember me?

1316
01:21:54,847 --> 01:21:56,053
Man, you look great.

1317
01:21:56,088 --> 01:21:58,096
Yeah, thanks.

1318
01:21:59,534 --> 01:22:01,535
Good to see somebody from the old neighborhood...

1319
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:03,672
What do you want, Jim?

1320
01:22:07,755 --> 01:22:09,563
- You holding anything? - No.

1321
01:22:09,598 --> 01:22:11,372
Just like a 5 or something?

1322
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,999
Just to tide me over, you know?

1323
01:22:14,973 --> 01:22:16,556
Please, Diane? Come on.

1324
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:20,634
Yeah. For an old friend? Why not?

1325
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:23,211
I've been looking all over for this.

1326
01:22:23,246 --> 01:22:25,753
Oh, you know what? I only got a 20.

1327
01:22:26,451 --> 01:22:27,771
A 20 is good.

1328
01:22:27,806 --> 01:22:29,056
- Yeah? - Yeah!

1329
01:22:29,091 --> 01:22:31,651
A 20 is great, yeah. That would help me out a lot.

1330
01:22:32,145 --> 01:22:33,696
- You want a 20? - Yeah.

1331
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:38,378
Why don't you go buy yourself some pretzels, you asshole.

1332
01:22:39,059 --> 01:22:41,602
You bitch! You're nothing but a whore!

1333
01:22:41,637 --> 01:22:44,146
I don't give a shit about your clothes!

1334
01:22:44,181 --> 01:22:46,079
You're still a whore to me!

1335
01:22:46,114 --> 01:22:50,295
Yeah? Shut up. Look at you. Oh, are you desperate now, baby?

1336
01:22:50,330 --> 01:22:51,619
Who's a whore now?

1337
01:22:51,654 --> 01:22:53,560
Don't talk to me like that, you bitch!

1338
01:22:53,595 --> 01:22:56,205
Ha ha. Who's laughing, stupid?

1339
01:22:57,588 --> 01:23:00,248
Don't play a game with me! I know you!

1340
01:23:03,251 --> 01:23:04,392
Ah!

1341
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:09,585
Shit.

1342
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:11,011
Oh, man.

1343
01:23:15,317 --> 01:23:16,619
Shit.

1344
01:24:26,779 --> 01:24:38,101
Ha ha ha!

1345
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,692
Mickey.

1346
01:25:09,727 --> 01:25:11,422
Mick, what's up, man?

1347
01:25:11,457 --> 01:25:12,985
Hey, what's up, man?

1348
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:14,478
Did you get anything?

1349
01:25:14,513 --> 01:25:15,991
No, not a dime. You score?

1350
01:25:16,026 --> 01:25:17,469
Yeah, I got something.

1351
01:25:17,955 --> 01:25:19,225
What'd you get?

1352
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:20,461
About 35 bucks.

1353
01:25:20,496 --> 01:25:23,028
35? Where'd you get it?

1354
01:25:24,793 --> 01:25:26,855
I robbed some fucking asshole on the "D" train.

1355
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:30,419
Dude, 35 will keep us on for, like, two days.

1356
01:25:30,454 --> 01:25:33,340
Well, could we get some stuff, man? I'm fucking... my head is...

1357
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:36,227
I see some spics. I think we can score. You wanna check it out?

1358
01:25:36,262 --> 01:25:39,610
- Yeah, alright. - Come on. They're over here.

1359
01:25:39,645 --> 01:25:42,407
Why the fuck do we have to cop on the street all the time?

1360
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:45,320
My fucking nuts are itching like crazy.

1361
01:25:45,355 --> 01:25:46,431
Think this is him?

1362
01:25:49,239 --> 01:25:50,764
Is your name Pino?

1363
01:25:52,381 --> 01:25:54,525
Listen... could we get us some dope?

1364
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,670
The dude over there said you could help.

1365
01:25:56,705 --> 01:25:58,485
You want to cop some shit?

1366
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,883
Let me see some cash.

1367
01:25:59,918 --> 01:26:01,180
I got it here.

1368
01:26:01,215 --> 01:26:02,408
Let me see.

1369
01:26:02,443 --> 01:26:04,078
Hey, no money without no taste.

1370
01:26:04,666 --> 01:26:06,439
You want a taste?

1371
01:26:06,474 --> 01:26:09,681
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1372
01:26:09,716 --> 01:26:10,850
Hurry, man.

1373
01:26:10,885 --> 01:26:12,146
Come on. There's fucking cops all over.

1374
01:26:12,181 --> 01:26:14,644
That's good, man. That's good.

1375
01:26:14,679 --> 01:26:17,107
All right, listen... 4 for 35.

1376
01:26:17,142 --> 01:26:18,633
4 for 35, man?

1377
01:26:18,668 --> 01:26:19,904
Come on, man. $5.00 short.

1378
01:26:19,939 --> 01:26:21,029
What's the big deal?

1379
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:23,823
Ta bien, chico... Toma, toma.

1380
01:26:23,838 --> 01:26:25,982
- You got four? - Yeah.

1381
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,463
We should taste this.

1382
01:26:29,498 --> 01:26:30,970
Where are we going to cook it up?

1383
01:26:31,005 --> 01:26:32,272
I don't know about his guy.

1384
01:26:32,307 --> 01:26:33,734
No, he's cool.

1385
01:26:35,275 --> 01:26:36,287
Fuck, man!

1386
01:26:36,322 --> 01:26:37,742
What's the matter?

1387
01:26:37,777 --> 01:26:40,186
- Just taste it! Come on. - What do you mean? I tasted it.

1388
01:26:41,758 --> 01:26:43,971
He beat us. He fucking beat us.

1389
01:26:44,006 --> 01:26:45,238
I swear to fucking God...

1390
01:26:45,273 --> 01:26:46,206
Put that away!

1391
01:26:46,241 --> 01:26:47,522
I'm gonna kill this mother...!

1392
01:26:47,557 --> 01:26:48,911
- Come here, motherfucker! - Put it away!

1393
01:26:53,651 --> 01:26:55,556
I'm going to fucking kill you, you motherfucker!

1394
01:26:57,029 --> 01:26:59,584
Motherfucker, you're fucking dead, you hear me?

1395
01:27:32,574 --> 01:27:33,924
Dude, don't make me do it.

1396
01:27:33,959 --> 01:27:34,865
Where's the money?

1397
01:27:36,934 --> 01:27:39,020
I want the money. I want the money and the bags.

1398
01:27:39,055 --> 01:27:40,548
Where's the fucking money?

1399
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:42,042
The fucking money! I want it!

1400
01:27:42,077 --> 01:27:45,360
Aah!

1401
01:27:45,465 --> 01:27:48,267
No!

1402
01:27:50,171 --> 01:27:52,256
-Oh, shit! - We fucking killed him!

1403
01:27:52,291 --> 01:27:53,937
What the fuck do you mean, we?

1404
01:27:53,972 --> 01:27:55,733
I didn't fucking touch him!

1405
01:27:55,768 --> 01:27:57,460
Don't put that shit on me!

1406
01:27:57,495 --> 01:28:00,560
He beat us, man! He deserved it!

1407
01:28:00,595 --> 01:28:03,625
You went too far, Mickey! Oh, shit!

1408
01:28:03,729 --> 01:28:04,785
Is he dead?

1409
01:28:04,786 --> 01:28:06,977
Of course he's fucking dead! He fell six stories!

1410
01:28:07,012 --> 01:28:08,052
Jim, come on.

1411
01:28:08,087 --> 01:28:12,004
Come on! Will you come one? Jim, don't make me leave you here!

1412
01:28:15,542 --> 01:28:17,262
Oh, shit.

1413
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:29,723
Star

1414
01:28:30,881 --> 01:28:32,957
I'll reach you if I try

1415
01:28:34,233 --> 01:28:36,066
Show me the truth, yeah

1416
01:28:37,615 --> 01:28:38,817
Star

1417
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,687
I'll reach you if I try

1418
01:28:43,742 --> 01:28:45,785
Show me the truth, yeah

1419
01:28:47,085 --> 01:28:50,419
Come on, get back up! Come on!

1420
01:29:02,903 --> 01:29:05,333
Get off of me! What are you doing?

1421
01:29:19,768 --> 01:29:21,005
Who is it?

1422
01:29:21,584 --> 01:29:24,237
Ma... let me in.

1423
01:29:26,675 --> 01:29:28,583
Ma, let me in!

1424
01:29:44,263 --> 01:29:46,016
Please, Ma.

1425
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:55,807
Ma? Hey, Ma?

1426
01:29:56,763 --> 01:29:57,468
Are you in there, Ma?

1427
01:29:58,589 --> 01:30:00,275
Ma, is that you?

1428
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:01,984
Yeah.

1429
01:30:02,019 --> 01:30:03,658
Ma? Ma?

1430
01:30:05,344 --> 01:30:07,002
- Are you there? - Yeah.

1431
01:30:07,037 --> 01:30:08,485
Hi.

1432
01:30:10,932 --> 01:30:13,452
Hi, Ma.

1433
01:30:13,487 --> 01:30:15,972
Hi. Hi.

1434
01:30:17,477 --> 01:30:20,345
Listen, I need you to help me out, all right?

1435
01:30:21,728 --> 01:30:23,266
I need you to give me some money.

1436
01:30:24,229 --> 01:30:26,142
Okay?

1437
01:30:26,789 --> 01:30:29,508
I need you to give me, like, five doll...

1438
01:30:29,543 --> 01:30:31,388
Like, $20, something like that

1439
01:30:31,423 --> 01:30:33,234
because I'm in some trouble.

1440
01:30:36,612 --> 01:30:38,076
Ma?

1441
01:30:38,111 --> 01:30:39,851
Do you hear me, Ma?

1442
01:30:39,886 --> 01:30:42,539
Yeah, I hear you. I can't help you.

1443
01:30:42,574 --> 01:30:43,425
Okay, listen,

1444
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:46,008
what you got to do is give me some money, okay?

1445
01:30:46,535 --> 01:30:48,195
Jim, I can't do that.

1446
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,441
Why not?

1447
01:30:50,476 --> 01:30:53,759
Mom, you know I'm not going to do anything with it.

1448
01:30:53,794 --> 01:30:57,043
I just need to go out of town for a little while

1449
01:30:57,078 --> 01:30:58,667
'cause I got into some trouble,

1450
01:30:58,702 --> 01:30:59,758
and I need some help.

1451
01:31:01,086 --> 01:31:03,223
Okay? So, you got to give me some money, Mom.

1452
01:31:03,707 --> 01:31:05,194
Can you hold my hand?

1453
01:31:05,229 --> 01:31:07,632
Yeah, I'll hold your hand.

1454
01:31:07,667 --> 01:31:09,820
Mom, can you give me some money, please?

1455
01:31:11,101 --> 01:31:13,127
Mom, can you give me some money, please?

1456
01:31:13,162 --> 01:31:15,119
Stop fucking around!

1457
01:31:15,154 --> 01:31:16,270
I can't.

1458
01:31:16,305 --> 01:31:19,719
Mom, give me some fucking money, please!

1459
01:31:19,754 --> 01:31:22,097
What are you doing? I'm your son!

1460
01:31:22,132 --> 01:31:23,566
I don't have any.

1461
01:31:23,601 --> 01:31:25,865
Mom, don't fuck around like this!

1462
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:27,642
Give me some money!

1463
01:31:27,677 --> 01:31:29,215
Mom!

1464
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:34,917
Come on! Let me in the fucking door!

1465
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,734
Oh, God.

1466
01:31:42,915 --> 01:31:45,862
Oh, fuck.

1467
01:31:49,841 --> 01:31:52,079
Let me in.

1468
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,564
I need some money.

1469
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,540
I need some money real bad.

1470
01:31:58,575 --> 01:32:01,418
Ohh...

1471
01:32:01,453 --> 01:32:04,262
Oh, God.

1472
01:32:05,023 --> 01:32:07,554
Someone's breaking into my apartment.

1473
01:32:08,714 --> 01:32:10,582
They have a knife.

1474
01:32:10,617 --> 01:32:12,371
Oh!

1475
01:32:12,406 --> 01:32:14,126
Mom!

1476
01:32:17,392 --> 01:32:20,328
You don't understand, Mom.

1477
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:24,950
You don't know what you're fucking doing to me.

1478
01:32:26,802 --> 01:32:29,441
Mom, I'm in pain.

1479
01:32:30,217 --> 01:32:34,529
How could you do this to your son, you bitch?

1480
01:32:34,564 --> 01:32:37,971
You fucking bitch!

1481
01:32:38,006 --> 01:32:39,433
Ah!

1482
01:32:50,021 --> 01:32:53,152
Oh, let me in!

1483
01:32:53,976 --> 01:32:59,004
I'll do anything! I'll be a good boy!

1484
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:02,564
I'll be a good boy, mom,

1485
01:33:02,599 --> 01:33:05,284
if you let me in.

1486
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:07,589
Get off me!

1487
01:33:08,463 --> 01:33:09,850
Get off!

1488
01:33:10,613 --> 01:33:11,705
No!

1489
01:33:13,274 --> 01:33:14,241
No!

1490
01:33:15,599 --> 01:33:17,240
You fuckers!

1491
01:33:17,515 --> 01:33:19,648
You're not going to do this! Fuck you!

1492
01:33:20,506 --> 01:33:23,046
Ma! Don't do this!

1493
01:33:23,842 --> 01:33:24,911
Ma!

1494
01:33:30,153 --> 01:33:31,592
Ma!

1495
01:33:37,116 --> 01:33:38,331
Ma!

1496
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:43,885
I got six months in Riker's Island

1497
01:33:44,388 --> 01:33:47,102
for assault, robbery,

1498
01:33:47,804 --> 01:33:50,715
resisting arrest, and possession of narcotics.

1499
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:53,769
I sweated out a horrible cure

1500
01:33:53,804 --> 01:33:55,829
and stayed clean the whole stretch

1501
01:33:55,864 --> 01:33:58,575
even though it's been easier to get good junk in here

1502
01:33:58,610 --> 01:34:00,441
than it is on the street.

1503
01:34:01,556 --> 01:34:03,127
Shit, it's been hard, man.

1504
01:34:03,162 --> 01:34:05,293
All I've been doing is reading these diaries

1505
01:34:05,328 --> 01:34:07,424
and wondering how the hell I'm still alive,

1506
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:10,052
and even if I care.

1507
01:34:11,245 --> 01:34:12,694
Suffice to say that I'm finished

1508
01:34:12,729 --> 01:34:15,303
with the asshole bandits of shower-room rape,

1509
01:34:15,338 --> 01:34:17,681
and suffice to say that those swine guards

1510
01:34:17,716 --> 01:34:20,025
won't draw blood from my ankles again.

1511
01:34:20,716 --> 01:34:23,388
Suffice to say that I've been just thinking about dumb stuff

1512
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:29,164
like what a nice concept it is to have a godmother and a godfather,

1513
01:34:29,653 --> 01:34:32,354
wondering who my godparents might be.

1514
01:34:34,157 --> 01:34:35,589
My mom won't visit me here,

1515
01:34:35,902 --> 01:34:39,137
so I guess I'll just have to wait till I get home to ask.

1516
01:34:46,672 --> 01:34:48,014
Jim?

1517
01:34:48,791 --> 01:34:49,944
Who's there?

1518
01:34:53,251 --> 01:34:54,471
It's me.

1519
01:34:55,779 --> 01:34:57,255
Pedro?

1520
01:34:59,638 --> 01:35:01,221
What's up, man?

1521
01:35:01,938 --> 01:35:02,959
Nothing. You know.

1522
01:35:02,994 --> 01:35:04,968
I... I hear you come here.

1523
01:35:05,003 --> 01:35:06,645
I just came by to say hi.

1524
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:08,253
I'm sorry about that night

1525
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,605
at the candy store and everything.

1526
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:12,864
It's all right. Reform school turned out to be real cool,

1527
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:15,227
so don't sweat it.

1528
01:35:17,144 --> 01:35:18,946
Did you hear about Mickey, that scumbag?

1529
01:35:18,981 --> 01:35:20,749
He went and threw some chump off a roof.

1530
01:35:21,876 --> 01:35:24,057
He's getting 5 to 15 years, man.

1531
01:35:24,092 --> 01:35:26,238
They tried him like an adult.

1532
01:35:26,916 --> 01:35:28,892
Shit.

1533
01:35:29,806 --> 01:35:31,917
I got a present for you, Jim.

1534
01:35:34,202 --> 01:35:36,240
A bag of the finest dope

1535
01:35:36,275 --> 01:35:37,662
in Manhattan.

1536
01:35:38,737 --> 01:35:39,876
You know, me and you?

1537
01:35:40,605 --> 01:35:41,856
Like old times?

1538
01:35:45,675 --> 01:35:47,146
I can't.

1539
01:35:49,234 --> 01:35:50,906
Come on. It would be dynamite.

1540
01:35:52,916 --> 01:35:54,340
I got this thing to do.

1541
01:35:55,497 --> 01:35:57,657
Why don't you come check it out?

1542
01:35:58,721 --> 01:36:00,665
No. I'm going to go, then, you know?

1543
01:36:01,774 --> 01:36:03,296
You know how it is.

1544
01:36:05,497 --> 01:36:07,414
Take care of yourself, little man.

1545
01:36:25,255 --> 01:36:26,760
Know this.

1546
01:36:27,756 --> 01:36:29,884
There's different types of users of junk.

1547
01:36:30,797 --> 01:36:32,726
You got your rich dilettante square-ass

1548
01:36:32,761 --> 01:36:34,144
who dabbles now and then

1549
01:36:35,034 --> 01:36:37,513
and always has enough money to run off to the Riviera

1550
01:36:37,548 --> 01:36:39,992
if he feels he's fucking around to the danger point.

1551
01:36:41,705 --> 01:36:44,242
Street junkies hate these pricks,

1552
01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:47,888
but they're always suckers, and their money makes them tolerable.

1553
01:36:49,517 --> 01:36:51,346
Then you got your upper-middle-class

1554
01:36:51,381 --> 01:36:52,980
Westchester preppies...

1555
01:36:53,759 --> 01:36:55,487
same as the others, basically.

1556
01:36:56,302 --> 01:36:59,203
What they're good for is opening their mommy and daddy's eyes

1557
01:36:59,238 --> 01:37:00,692
to this social virus

1558
01:37:00,727 --> 01:37:02,418
and putting pressure on the government

1559
01:37:02,453 --> 01:37:04,314
to do something about it.

1560
01:37:06,670 --> 01:37:08,449
Then there's us street kids.

1561
01:37:09,074 --> 01:37:12,168
Start fucking around very young,

1562
01:37:13,605 --> 01:37:15,564
13 or so...

1563
01:37:17,555 --> 01:37:19,932
We think we all got it under control

1564
01:37:19,967 --> 01:37:22,773
and won't get strung out.

1565
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,832
This rarely works.

1566
01:37:26,974 --> 01:37:28,974
I'm living proof.

1567
01:37:30,555 --> 01:37:33,954
But in the end, you just got to see the junk

1568
01:37:33,989 --> 01:37:35,683
as another 9-to-5 gig.

1569
01:37:38,157 --> 01:37:44,928
The hours are just a bit more inclined to shadows.
