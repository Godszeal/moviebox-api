but hey, hey, don't worry about it.

112
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,208
There's still plenty\nof places it could be.

113
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,583
Hell, yes! The floor debris in the suite,\nthe mother's room,

Where's the photograph of the necklace?

Of course, everyone knows\nthe familiar stories of Titanic.

You know, the nobility, the band playing\ntill the very end and all that,

00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,458
but what I'm interested in\nare the untold stories,

00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,333
the secrets locked\ndeep inside the hull of Titanic.

140
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,500
We're out here using robot technology

141
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,583

142

144
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,208
Many are calling you a grave robber.

145
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,500
Well, nobody ever called\nthe recovery of the artifacts

146
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,250
-of King Tut's tomb "grave robbing."\n-What is it?

147

Turn that up, dear.

150
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,875
Take a look at this drawing\nthat we found just today.

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,250
A piece of paper that's been underwater\nfor 84 years,

152
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,375
and my team were able\nto preserve it intact.

153
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,291
Should this have remained unseen\nat the bottom of the ocean for eternity?

154
00:11:58,542 --> 00:11:59,625
We can see it and enjoy it...

155
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,542

(yelling) She's a goddamn liar!

175
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:12,417
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

176
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,333
God only knows why,\nlike that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:27,250
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic\nwhen she was 17, right?

179
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,417
That's right.

180
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,208
If she had lived,\nshe'd be over 100 by now.

181
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,917
101 next month.

182
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:36,834
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

183
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,500
Look, I've already done\nthe background on this woman

184
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,417
all the way back to the '20s

185
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,375
when she was working as an actress.

186
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,583
An actress!

187
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,667
There's your first clue, Sherlock!

188
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,083
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.

189
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,041
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

190
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,709
They move to Cedar Rapids,\nand she punches out a couple of kids.

191
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,083
Now, Calvert's dead,

192
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,291
and from what I hear,\nCedar Rapids is dead.

193
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,750
And everybody who knows about the diamond

194
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:02,375
is supposed to be dead or on this boat,\nbut she knows.

195
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,875
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

196
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,875
Hurry up! Give them a hand!

197
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,792
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.

198
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,250
Welcome to the Keldysh.

199
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,333
Okay, let's get her inside there.

200
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,250
Hi, Ms. Calvert.

201
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,417
-Hi.\n-Welcome to the Keldysh.

202
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,709
MAN: Hey!

203
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,083
(knocking on door)

204
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,000
ROSE: Yes.

205
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,917
Are your staterooms all right?

206
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,333
Oh, yes. Very nice.

207
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:51,333
Have you met my granddaughter Lizzie?

208
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:53,125
She takes care of me.

209
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,083
We met just a few minutes ago.

210
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,417
Remember, Nana, up on deck?

211
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,458
ROSE: There, that's nice.

212
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:04,250
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

213
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,583
Can I get you anything?

214
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:06,875
Is there anything you'd like?

215
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,041
Yes.

216
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,667
I would like to see my drawing.

217
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,500
BROCK: Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone

218
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,875
that was called\nthe Blue Diamond of the Crown

219
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,959
which disappeared in 1792,

220
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,291
about the same time old Louis\nlost everything from the neck up.

221
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:42,333
The theory goes that the crown diamond\nwas chopped, too,

222
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:46,750
recut into a heart-like shape that became\nknown as "the Heart of the Ocean."

223
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:49,458
Today, it would be worth\nmore than the Hope Diamond.

224
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:52,000
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.

225
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,417
I only wore it this once.

226
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,083
You actually think this is you, Nana?

227
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,166
It is me, dear.

228
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,834
Wasn't I a dish?

229
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,667
I tracked it down\nthrough insurance records.

230
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,625
An old claim that was settled\nunder terms of absolute secrecy.

231
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:13,834
Can you tell me\nwho the claimant was, Rose?

232
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:16,417
I should imagine someone named Hockley.

233
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,792
BROCK: Nathan Hockley,\nthat's right.

234
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,959
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

235
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,625
Claim was for a diamond necklace

236
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:26,083
his son Caledon bought his fianc茅e, you,

237
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,166
a week before he sailed on Titanic.

238
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,583
It was filed right after the sinking,

239
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,458
so the diamond had to have\ngone down with the ship.

240
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:39,041
You see the date?

241
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,875
"April 14, 1912."

242
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,667
Which means if your grandmother\nis who she says she is,

243
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,500
she was wearing the diamond\nthe day the Titanic sank.

244
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,750
And that makes you my new best friend.

245
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:55,750
These are some of the things we recovered\nfrom your stateroom.

246
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:00,250
This was mine.

247
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,959
How extraordinary!

248
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,917
And it looks the same as it did\nthe last time I saw it.

249
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:16,291
The reflection has changed a bit.

250
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,208
(gasps quietly)

251
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:34,917
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?

252
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,166
LEWIS: Okay, here we go.

253
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,709
She hits the berg on\nthe starboard side, right?

254
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:43,917
She kind of bumps along

255
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,333
punching holes like Morse code...\n(makes beeping noise)

256
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:49,041
...along the side, below the waterline.

257
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,250
Then the forward compartments\nstart to flood.

258
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,166
Now, as the water level rises,

259
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,291
it spills over the watertight bulkheads

260
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,333
which unfortunately don't go\nany higher than "E" deck.

261
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:02,291
So now as the bow goes down,\nthe stern rises up,

262
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,709
slow at first then faster and faster

263
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,625
until finally, she's got her whole ass\nis sticking up in the air

264
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:08,792
and that's a big ass.

265
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,083
We're talking 20,000, 30,000 tons, okay?

266
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,375
And the hull's not designed\nto deal with that pressure,

267
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,041
so what happens? (makes cracking sound)

268
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,500
She splits, right down to the keel,

269
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,458
and the stern falls back level.

270
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:25,083
Then as the bow sinks,\nit pulls the stern vertical

271
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,417
and then finally detaches.

272
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,375
Now, the stern section\njust kind of bobs there like a cork

273
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,041
for a couple of minutes,

274
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,750
floods, and finally goes under\nabout 2:20 a.m.

275
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:37,834
Two hours and 40 minutes\nafter the collision.

276
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,917
The bow section planes away,

277
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,625
landing about a half a mile away,

278
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:45,625
going 20, 30 knots\nwhen it hits the ocean floor.

279
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:48,000
(imitates crashing)

280
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,792
Pretty cool, huh?

281
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:56,083
Thank you for that fine\nforensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

282
00:18:56,166 --> 00:19:02,500
Of course, the experience of it\nwas... somewhat different.

283
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,792
Will you share it with us?

284
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,125
(sonar pings in distance)

285
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,959
(orchestral music playing)

286
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,083
(crying)

287
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,041
I'm taking her to rest.

288
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,000
No.

289
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,083
Come on, Nana.

290
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,250
No!

291
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,792
Tape recorder.

292
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,542
Tell us, Rose.

293
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,000
It's been 84 years.

294
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,458
It's okay. Just try to remember anything,\nanything at all.

295
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,333
Do you want to hear this or not,\nMr. Lovett?

296
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:35,125
It's been 84 years...

297
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,500
and I can still smell the fresh paint.

298
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:43,625
The china had never been used.

299
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,250
The sheets had never been slept in.

300
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,792
Titanic was called "the Ship of Dreams,"

301
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:57,041
and it was, it really was.

302
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,041
(people talking indistinctly)

303
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:31,250
MAN: All third-class passengers\nwith a forward berth

304
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,750
this way, please, this queue. Right here.

305
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:35,792
It's a big boat, huh?

306
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,417
-Daddy, it's a ship.\n-You're right.

307
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,834
(car horn honking)

308
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:10,834
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

309
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,750
It doesn't look any bigger\nthan the Mauritania.

310
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:17,750
but not about Titanic.
You can be blas茅 about some things, Rose,

311
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:19,542
It's over 100 feet longer than Mauritania

312
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,125
and far more luxurious.

313
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:23,959
Your daughter is far too difficult\nto impress, Ruth.

314
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:24,875
(chuckles)

315
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,792
So this is the ship\nthey say is unsinkable.

316
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:28,709
It is unsinkable.

317
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:30,625
God himself could not sink this ship.

318
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:32,792
Sir, you have to check\nyour baggage through the main terminal.

319
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,250
It's round that way, sir.

320
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,375
I put my faith in you, good sir.

321
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:37,333
Now, kindly see my man.

322
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, yes, sir. My pleasure, sir.\nIf I can do anything at all...

323
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,458
Oh, yes, right.

324
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,875
All the trunks from that car there,

325
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:46,875
12 from here, and the safe...

326
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,667
to the parlor suite, rooms B-52, 54, 56.

327
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,834
(whistle blowing)

328
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:54,083
Ladies...

329
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,125
we better hurry.

330
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,250
-My coat?\n-WOMAN: I have it, miss.

331
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,875
MAN: All third-class passengers queue here\nfor health inspection.

332
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:09,625
All third-class passengers queue here\nfor health inspection.

333
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,417
Chin up.

334
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,333
Welcome aboard, ma'am.

335
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:19,041
Welcome to Titanic.

336
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:24,417
ROSE (narrating): It was the\nShip of Dreams to everyone else.

337
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,250
To me, it was a slave ship

338
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,250
taking me back to America in chains.

339
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:35,750
Outwardly, I was everything\na well-brought-up girl should be.

340
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:38,500
Inside, I was screaming.

341
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,000
(steam whistle blows loudly)

342
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,834
(speaking Swedish)

343
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:55,959
Jack, you are pazzo.

344
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,583
You bet everything we have.

345
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,500
When you got nothing,\nyou got nothing to lose.

346
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:02,917
(speaking Swedish)

347
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:10,041
Sven?

348
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:11,959
(speaking Swedish)

349
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:30,500
(clock ticking)

350
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,250
All right, moment of truth.

351
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,834
Somebody's life's about to change.

352
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:37,917
Fabrizio?

353
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,959
Niente.

354
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:42,208
Niente.

355
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:44,458
Olaf?

356
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:46,542
Nothing.

357
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:47,709
Sven?

358
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,417
Uh-oh.

359
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,667
Two pair.

360
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

361
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:58,583
Che "sorry?" Ma vaffanculo!\nYou bet all the money.

362
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:02,375
I'm sorry, you're not gonna\nsee your mom again for a long time...

363
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:04,041
'cause we're going to America.

364
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,875
Full house, boys! Woo-hoo!

365
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,500
(cheering)

366
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,583
-Yeah!\n-(screaming)

367
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:11,125
Dio mio, grazie!

368
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:15,291
(cursing in Swedish)

369
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,667
-Come on.\n-(speaking Italian)

370
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,583
I'm going home!

371
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:26,250
(cursing in Swedish)

372
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:27,959
I'm going home.

373
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,667
I go to America.

374
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,000
MAN: No, mate.

375
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:34,500
Titanic go to America in five minutes.

376
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,125
Come on. Come on, here.

377
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:39,750
(Fabrizio speaking Italian)

378
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:41,667
We're riding in high style now.

379
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,166
We're a couple of regular swells.

380
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,709
We're practically goddamn royalty,\nragazzo mio.

381
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:49,625
FABRIZIO: You see, it's my destino!

382
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:52,125
Like I told you, I go to America\nto be milionario.

383
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,375
DRIVER: Whoa, whoa!

384
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:54,583
Bastardo!

385
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:56,917
You're pazzo!

386
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,917
Maybe, but I've got the tickets.

387
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,375
Come on, I thought you were fast.

388
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:03,333
Aspetta!

389
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:05,291
Whoa! Wait, wait!

390
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,291
Hey, wait.

391
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,417
We're passengers.

392
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,875
Passengers.

393
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:12,500
Have you been through\nthe inspection queue?

394
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,417
Of course!

395
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,542
Anyway, we don't have any lice.

396
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,917
We're Americans, both of us.

397
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,667
Right, come aboard.

398
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:26,166
We're the luckiest sons of bitches\nin the world, you know that?

399
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,417
(ship's horn blaring)

400
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,125
Goodbye!

401
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:41,458
You know somebody?

402
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:42,834
Of course not. That's not the point.

403
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:44,500
Goodbye! I'll miss you!

404
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:45,417
Goodbye!

405
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:48,083
I will never forget you.

406
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,959
(crowd cheering)

407
00:26:57,792 --> 00:26:59,917
(engines rumbling)

408
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,834
(steamboat honking)

409
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:23,125
(people shouting goodbyes)

410
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,291
All the way, darling.

411
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,375
360, 360...

412
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,500
Excuse me, ma'am.

413
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,458
360...

414
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,834
Oh, right here.

415
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,166
Hey, how you doing?

416
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,125
Jack.

417
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,375
Nice to meet you.

418
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,500
I'm Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.

419
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,083
How you doing?

420
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,000
Who says you get top bunk, huh?

421
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,750
(speaking Swedish)

422
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:09,542
This is your private promenade deck, sir.

423
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:11,208
Would you be requiring anything?

424
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,375
-Hmm...\n-Excuse me.

425
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,291
WOMAN: This one?

426
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:16,959
ROSE: No.\nIt had a lot of faces on it.

427
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:19,542
This is the one.

428
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,458
Would you like all of them out, miss?

429
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:26,750
Yes. We need a little color\nin this room.

430
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,500
Uh, put it in there, in the wardrobe.

431
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:34,875
God, not those finger paintings again.

432
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:36,959
They certainly were a waste of money.

433
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:40,166
The difference between Cal's taste in art\nand mine is that I have some.

434
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,375
They're fascinating.

435
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:44,875
Like being inside a dream or something.

436
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,333
There's truth, but no logic.

437
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:47,709
What's the artist's name?

438
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,750
Something Picasso.

439
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:51,291
(scoffs) "Something Picasso."

440
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,875
He won't amount to a thing.

441
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,083
He won't, trust me.

442
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,333
Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.

443
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:56,625
At least they were cheap.

444
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,208
Uh, put it in the wardrobe.

445
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:09,333
ROSE (narrating): At Cherbourg, a woman\ncame aboard named Margaret Brown.

446
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,291
We all called her Molly.

447
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,792
History would call her\n"The Unsinkable Molly Brown."

448
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:17,166
Well, I wasn't about to wait\nall day for you, sonny.

449
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,083
Here, you think you can manage?

450
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,792
ROSE (narrating): Her husband had\nstruck gold someplace out West,

451
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:26,417
and she was what Mother called\n"new money."

452
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:30,208
By the next afternoon,\nwe were steaming west

453
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:31,875
from the coast of Ireland

454
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:35,834
with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.

455
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:44,667
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.

456
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,750
Let's stretch her legs.

457
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:48,250
Yes, sir.

458
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,375
All ahead full, Mr. Moody.

459
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,625
Very good, sir.

460
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,208
(bells ringing)

461
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:57,417
(bell dings)

462
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,000
All ahead full.

463
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:01,875
MAN (shouting): All ahead full!

464
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:04,166
Come on, lads. Get moving.

465
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:11,792
What's the reading?

466
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:20,834
(hissing)

467
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,208
FOREMAN: All right,\nlet's stoke 'em right up!

468
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,750
We're going full ahead!

469
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,667
Come on. Put you backs into it!

470
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,041
(indistinct chatter)

471
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:24,333
Twenty-one knots, sir.

472
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,333
Hey, look, look, look! Look, look!

473
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:39,166
See it?

474
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:44,375
There's another one. See him?

475
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,750
Look at that one. Look at him jump!

476
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,166
Whoo-hoo!

477
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,583
(wind whistling)

478
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Whoo!

479
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:25,041
I can see the Statue of Liberty already!

480
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:27,625
Very small, of course.

481
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:34,125
I'm the king of the world!

482
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:37,083
(whooping and yelling)

483
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,709
(whooping)

484
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:24,333
She's the largest moving object ever made\nby the hand of man in all history.

485
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,375
And our master shipbuilder,\nMr. Andrews here

486
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:29,583
designed her from the keel plates up.

487
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:33,208
Well, I may have knocked her together,\nbut the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

488
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,333
He envisioned a steamer

489
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:39,125
so grand in scale and so luxurious\nin its appointments

490
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:41,333
that its supremacy\nwould never be challenged.

491
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:42,250
And here she is...

492
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,208
willed into solid reality.

493
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:46,250
MAN: Hear, hear.

494
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:54,041
You know I don't like that, Rose.

495
00:33:58,208 --> 00:33:59,166
She knows.

496
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,625
We'll both have the lamb.

497
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,417
Rare, with very little mint sauce.

498
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:08,709
Hmm. You like lamb,\nright, sweet pea?

499
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,709
You gonna cut her meat\nfor her, too, there, Cal?

500
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:19,000
Hey, uh, who thought\nof the name "Titanic"?

501
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:20,750
Was it you, Bruce?

502
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:23,083
Well, yes, actually.

503
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:25,083
I wanted to convey sheer size,

504
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:27,250
and size means stability,

505
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:30,792
luxury, and above all,\nstrength.

506
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:34,333
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

507
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:36,834
His ideas about the male\npreoccupation with size

508
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:38,750
might be of particular interest to you.

509
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,500
What's gotten into you?

510
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:42,625
Excuse me.

511
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,000
I do apologize.

512
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,709
She's a pistol, Cal.

513
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:51,875
Hope you can handle her.

514
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:54,583
Well, I may have to start\nminding what she reads from now on,

515
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:55,875
won't I, Mrs. Brown?

516
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:57,291
Freud, who is he?

517
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,500
Is he a passenger?

518
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,250
...it turns the propeller

519
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,583
and makes these waves, makes them spin.

520
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,750
It turns and turns...

521
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:13,667
FABRIZIO: The ship is nice, huh?

522
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,250
Yeah, it's an Irish ship.

523
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,750
Is English, no?

524
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:19,333
No, it was built in Ireland.\n15,000 Irishmen built this ship.

525
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,583
Solid as a rock.

526
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:21,583
Big Irish hands.

527
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:23,875
That's typical.

528
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:26,500
First-class dogs come down here\nto take a shiite.

529
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,041
Uh, it lets us know where we rank\nin the scheme of things.

530
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,250
Like we could forget?

531
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,375
(Jack chuckles)

532
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:34,667
I'm Tommy Ryan.

533
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,125
-Jack Dawson.\n-Hello.

534
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,125
-Fabrizio.\n-Hi

535
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,542
Do you make any money with your drawings?

536
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,083
Oh, forget it, boyo.

537
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:57,000
You'd as like have angels fly out of your\narse as get next to the likes of her.

538
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,083
(laughs)

539
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,875
(talking indistinctly)

540
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:24,834
ROSE (narrating): I saw my whole life\nas if I'd already lived it,

541
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:28,667
an endless parade\nof parties and cotillions,

542
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,583
yachts and polo matches,

543
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:36,041
always the same narrow people,\nthe same mindless chatter.

544
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,917
I felt like I was standing\nat a great precipice

545
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,667
with no one to pull me back,

546
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:47,709
no one who cared or even noticed.

547
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:51,709
(panting)

548
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:55,417
(woman grunts)

549
00:36:56,166 --> 00:37:00,834
(Rose sobbing)

550
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:22,083
(Rose running and sobbing)

551
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,000
(panting)

552
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,917
(breathing heavily)

553
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:39,750
Don't do it.

554
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:41,458
Stay back.

555
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:43,750
Don't come any closer.

556
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:46,417
Come on.

557
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,125
Just give me your hand.\nI'll pull you back over.

558
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:49,917
No! Stay where you are.

559
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:51,750
I mean it.

560
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:54,208
I'll let go.

561
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,375
No, you won't.

562
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,458
What do you mean, no, I won't?

563
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:12,667
Don't presume to tell me\nwhat I will and will not do.

564
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,250
You don't know me.

565
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,458
Well, you would have done it already.

566
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:19,625
You're distracting me. Go away.

567
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:22,166
I can't. I'm involved now.

568
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:26,542
You let go, and I'm gonna have to\njump in there after you.

569
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:29,417
Don't be absurd.

570
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,417
You'll be killed.

571
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,834
I'm a good swimmer.

572
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:34,792
The fall alone would kill you.

573
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,291
It would hurt.

574
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,625
I'm not saying it wouldn't.

575
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:39,667
To tell you the truth,

576
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,583
I'm a lot more concerned\nabout that water being so cold.

577
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:51,291
How cold?

578
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:52,792
Freezing.

579
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:54,834
Maybe a couple degrees over.

580
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:00,750
You ever, uh,

581
00:40:00,834 --> 00:40:02,291
ever been to Wisconsin?

582
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:06,959
What?

583
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:09,583
Well, they have\nsome of the coldest winters around.

584
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:12,208
I grew up there near Chippewa Falls.

585
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:14,250
I remember when I was a kid,

586
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:18,500
me and my father, we went ice fishing\nout on Lake Wissota.

587
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,542
Ice fishing is, you know, where you--

588
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:22,250
(angrily) I know what ice fishing is!

589
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:23,208
(scoffs)

590
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:24,667
Sorry.

591
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:29,709
You just seem like, you know,\nkind of an indoor girl.

592
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:33,959
Anyway, I, uh...

593
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:36,208
I fell through some thin ice,

594
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:37,792
and I'm telling you,

595
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:42,959
water that cold, like right down there,

596
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:47,166
it hits you like a thousand knives\nstabbing you all over your body.

597
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:51,041
You can't breathe, you can't think...

598
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,208
At least not about anything but the pain.

599
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:01,333
Which is why I'm not looking forward\nto jumping in there after you.

600
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:03,917
Like I said...

601
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:07,166
I don't have a choice.

602
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:13,291
I guess I'm kind of hoping\nyou'll come back over the rail

603
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:15,125
and get me off the hook here.

604
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:18,166
You're crazy.

605
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,166
That's what everybody says, but...

606
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,458
with all due respect, miss,

607
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:27,291
I'm not the one hanging off\nthe back of a ship here.

608
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:29,333
Come on.

609
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:31,667
Come on, give me your hand.

610
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:34,291
You don't want to do this.

611
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:49,333
Phew!

612
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:51,291
I'm Jack Dawson.

613
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,041
(breathing heavily)

614
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:55,083
Rose DeWitt Bukater.

615
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:56,834
I'm gonna have to get you\nto write that one down.

616
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:57,750
(chuckles)

617
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,500
Come on.

618
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:03,875
(screams)

619
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:05,750
(grunting)

620
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:06,750
I got you!

621
00:42:06,834 --> 00:42:07,792
Come on.

622
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:09,959
Come on!

623
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:14,375
(screaming)

624
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:15,875
Help! Please!

625
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:18,417
Help! Please!

626
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:20,291
Please help me!

627
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:21,625
Listen, listen to me.

628
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:23,750
I've got you. I won't let go.

629
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:26,125
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

630
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:27,291
(grunts)

631
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:30,709
Come on. That's right.

632
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:32,959
You can do it.

633
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:39,083
I've got you.

634
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:45,583
What's all this?

635
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:48,875
(breathing heavily)

636
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:54,625
You stand back! And don't move an inch!

637
00:42:56,959 --> 00:42:58,792
Fetch the master-at-arms!

638
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,000
Care for a brandy?

639
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:02,333
CAL: This is completely\nunacceptable!

640
00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:05,750
What made you think that you could
put your hands on my fianc茅e?

641
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:08,667
Look at me, you filth!

642
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,625
Cal...

643
00:43:09,709 --> 00:43:10,792
What do you think you were doing?

644
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,208
Cal, stop.

645
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:13,792
It was an accident.

646
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:15,667
An accident?

647
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:17,959
It was.

648
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:20,208
Stupid really.

649
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:22,875
I was leaning over, and I slipped.

650
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:29,083
I was leaning far over to see the, uh...

651
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:30,542
Uh, uh...

652
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,375
The, uh, uh...

653
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:35,458
-Propellers?\n-Propellers, and I slipped.

654
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:39,458
And I would have gone overboard,\nbut Mr. Dawson here saved me.

655
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:41,333
and almost went over himself.

656
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:43,875
You wanted to see... She wanted to see\nthe propellers.

657
00:43:43,959 --> 00:43:47,375
Like I said, women and machinery\ndo not mix.

658
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,959
Was that the way of it?

659
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:54,709
Yeah. Yeah, that was pretty much it.

660
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:56,208
Well, the boy's a hero, then.

661
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:58,458
Good for you, son. Well done.

662
00:43:58,542 --> 00:44:01,333
So, it's all's well,\nand back to our brandy, eh?

663
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:04,959
Look at you. You must be freezing.

664
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:06,667
Let's get you inside.

665
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,875
Uh, perhaps a little something\nfor the boy.

666
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:13,291
Of course.

667
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:16,667
Uh, Mr. Lovejoy,\nI think a 20 should do it.

668
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:20,458
(chuckles) Is that the going rate\nfor saving the woman you love?

669
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,500
Rose is displeased.

670
00:44:24,417 --> 00:44:25,250
What to do?

671
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,500
I know.

672
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,542
Perhaps you could join us\nfor dinner tomorrow evening

673
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:37,333
to regale our group with your heroic tale.

674
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:42,250
Sure, count me in.

675
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:43,458
Good.

676
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:44,750
Settled then.

677
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:47,291
This should be interesting.

678
00:44:52,834 --> 00:44:53,667
(whistles)

679
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,000
Can I, uh, bum a smoke?

680
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,291
You'll want to tie those.

681
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,083
It's interesting...

682
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:15,041
that the young lady slipped so suddenly

683
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:18,959
and you still had time\nto remove your jacket and your shoes.

684
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,834
(music box playing)

685
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:28,375
(knocking on door)

686
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:29,875
(door opens)

687
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:36,875
I know you've been melancholy.

688
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,166
I don't pretend to know why.

689
00:45:42,709 --> 00:45:45,000
I intended to save this

690
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:49,959
until the engagement gala next week.

691
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:55,000
But I thought tonight.

692
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:57,583
Good gracious.

693
00:45:57,667 --> 00:46:01,458
(chuckles) Perhaps as a reminder\nof my feelings for you.

694
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:04,000
-Is it a--\n-Diamond? Yes.

695
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:09,417
Fifty-six carats to be exact.

696
00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:13,834
It was worn by Louis XVI,

697
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:17,208
and they called it "Le Coeur de la Mer."

698
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:18,917
BOTH: The Heart of the Ocean.

699
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,291
Yes.

700
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:27,917
It's overwhelming.

701
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,750
Well, it's for royalty.

702
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:33,208
We are royalty, Rose.

703
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:39,375
You know, there's nothing\nI couldn't give you.

704
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:42,041
There's nothing I'd deny you...

705
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:44,792
if you would not deny me.

706
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:51,709
Oh, open your heart to me, Rose.

707
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:09,750
JACK: Well, I've been on my own\nsince I was 15,

708
00:47:09,834 --> 00:47:11,375
since my folks died.

709
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:13,750
And I had no brothers or sisters

710
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:16,458
or close kin in that part of the country.

711
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,250
So I lit on out of there and I haven't\nbeen back since.

712
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:22,041
You could just call me a tumbleweed\nblowing in the wind.

713
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:27,000
Well, Rose,

714
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:28,959
we've walked about a mile\naround this boat deck

715
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:32,250
and chewed over how great\nthe weather's been and how I grew up,

716
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:35,625
but I reckon that's not why\nyou came to talk to me, is it?

717
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:40,125
-Mr. Dawson, I--\n-Jack.

718
00:47:40,917 --> 00:47:43,041
Jack...

719
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:46,375
I want to thank you for what you did.

720
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:49,083
Not just for... for pulling me back,

721
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,458
but for your discretion.

722
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:52,667
You're welcome.

723
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,500
Look, I know what you must be thinking.

724
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,834
Poor little rich girl.

725
00:47:59,917 --> 00:48:02,083
What does she know about misery?

726
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:03,125
No.

727
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:05,834
No, that's not what I was thinking.

728
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,375
What I was thinking was\nwhat could have happened to this girl

729
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:11,667
to make her think she had no way out?

730
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,291
Well, I...

731
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:17,583
It was everything.

732
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:21,583
It was my whole world\nand all the people in it,

733
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:27,083
and the inertia of my life plunging ahead\nand me, powerless to stop it.

734
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:29,750
God! Look at that thing.

735
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:31,750
You would've gone straight to the bottom.

736
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:36,375
Five hundred invitations have gone out.

737
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:39,500
All of Philadelphia society will be there,

738
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,792
and all the while I feel I'm...

739
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:43,750
standing in the middle of a crowded room

740
00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:45,333
screaming at the top of my lungs,

741
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:46,875
and no one even looks up.

742
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:49,834
Do you love him?

743
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,417
Pardon me?

744
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,500
Do you love him?

745
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:56,291
You're being very rude.

746
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:57,500
You shouldn't be asking me this.

747
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:59,083
Well, it's a simple question.

748
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:00,458
Do you love the guy or not?

749
00:49:02,834 --> 00:49:05,000
This is not a suitable conversation.

750
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:06,542
Why can't you just answer the question?

751
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:09,208
(laughs nervously)

752
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:11,125
This is absurd.

753
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,709
You don't know me and I don't know you,

754
00:49:12,792 --> 00:49:15,333
and we are not having\nthis conversation at all.

755
00:49:15,417 --> 00:49:17,834
You are rude and uncouth and presumptuous,

756
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:19,875
and I am leaving now.

757
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:22,625
Jack... Mr. Dawson, it's been a pleasure.

758
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:23,917
I sought you out to thank you,

759
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,083
and now I have thanked you...

760
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:26,458
And you've insulted me.

761
00:49:27,291 --> 00:49:28,667
Well, you deserved it.

762
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,375
-Right.\n-Right.

763
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:34,959
I thought you were leaving.

764
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:35,959
I am.

765
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:39,917
You are so annoying.

766
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,583
-(chuckles)\n-Wait.

767
00:49:41,667 --> 00:49:43,250
I don't have to leave.

768
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:45,250
This is my part of the ship.

769
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:46,208
You leave.

770
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:48,458
(chuckles) Well, well, well.

771
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:50,041
Now who's being rude?

772
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,959
(scoffs)

773
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:56,625
What is this stupid thing\nyou're carrying around?

774
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:00,208
So what are you, an artist or something?

775
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:06,000
Well, these are rather good.

776
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:11,208
They're, uh...

777
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:13,041
They're very good, actually.

778
00:50:19,792 --> 00:50:22,041
Jack, this is exquisite work.

779
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:25,166
Uh, they didn't think too much\nof 'em in old Paree.

780
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,875
Paris?

781
00:50:27,709 --> 00:50:30,250
You do get around for a poor...

782
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:35,041
Well, uh, uh, a person of limited means.

783
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:37,959
Go on, a poor guy, you can say it.

784
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:42,959
Well, well, well.

785
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,041
And these were drawn from life?

786
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:54,709
Well, that's one\nof the good things about Paris,

787
00:50:54,792 --> 00:50:56,542
lots of girls willing\nto take their clothes off.

788
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,583
You liked this woman.

789
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:07,041
You used her several times.

790
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:12,250
Well, she had beautiful hands,\nyou see?

791
00:51:14,959 --> 00:51:16,834
I think you must have had\na love affair with her.

792
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:17,792
No, no, no, no, no.

793
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,792
Just with her hands.

794
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:22,667
She was a one-legged prostitute.

795
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:24,458
See?

796
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:28,125
(aghast) Oh!

797
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:31,041
(both chuckle)

798
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:33,125
Ah, she had a good sense of humor, though.

799
00:51:35,917 --> 00:51:36,834
Oh, and this lady,

800
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,917
she used to sit at this bar every night

801
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,125
wearing every piece of jewelry she owned,

802
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:45,417
just waiting for her long-lost love.

803
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:49,542
Called her Madame Bijou.

804
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:51,667
See how her clothes are all moth-eaten?

805
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:56,250
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

806
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,125
You do.

807
00:51:58,208 --> 00:51:59,583
You see people.

808
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:01,709
I see you.

809
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:05,375
And?

810
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:08,250
You wouldn't have jumped.

811
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:16,291
But the purpose of university\nis to find a suitable husband.

812
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:18,208
Rose has already done that.

813
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:21,041
Look, here comes that vulgar Brown woman.

814
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:23,625
Quickly, get up before she sits with us.

815
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,083
Hello, girls.

816
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:27,875
I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.

817
00:52:27,959 --> 00:52:29,834
We're awfully sorry, you missed it.

818
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:31,542
The countess and I were just off

819
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:33,125
to take the air on the boat deck.

820
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:34,250
What a lovely idea.

821
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:35,917
I need to catch up on my gossip.

822
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:41,000
Countess.

823
00:52:42,417 --> 00:52:44,834
So you've not yet lit\nthe last four boilers?

824
00:52:45,959 --> 00:52:47,709
No, I don't see the need.

825
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:49,417
We are making excellent time.

826
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,750
The press knows the size of Titanic.

827
00:52:52,834 --> 00:52:55,000
Now I want them to marvel at her speed.

828
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:57,375
We must give them something new to print.

829
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,959
This maiden voyage of Titanic\nmust make headlines.

830
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:05,291
Mr. Ismay,

831
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:07,959
I would prefer not to push the engines

832
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:10,041
until they've been properly run in.

833
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:13,375
Of course I'm just a passenger.

834
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:15,166
I leave it to your good offices\nto decide what's best.

835
00:53:16,834 --> 00:53:18,834
But what a glorious end\nto your final crossing

836
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:22,125
if we were to get into New York\non Tuesday night and surprise them all.

837
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:23,709
Make the morning papers.

838
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:26,458
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

839
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,750
Good man.

840
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:35,667
Well, after that, I worked on\na squid boat in Monterey.

841
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,542
Then I went down to Los Angeles\nto the pier in Santa Monica

842
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:41,291
and started doing portraits there\nfor ten cents apiece.

843
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:43,917
Why can't I be like you, Jack?

844
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:47,959
Just head out for the horizon\nwhenever I feel like it.

845
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:53,041
Say we'll go there sometime to that pier,

846
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:55,417
even if we only ever just talk about it.

847
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,083
No, we'll do it.

848
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:58,750
We'll drink cheap beer.

849
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:01,125
We'll ride on the roller coaster\ntill we throw up.

850
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:05,208
Then we'll ride horses on the beach,\nright in the surf.

851
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:07,125
Now, but you'll have to do it\nlike a real cowboy.

852
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:08,917
None of that sidesaddle stuff.

853
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:11,875
You mean, one leg on each side?

854
00:54:11,959 --> 00:54:12,834
Yeah.

855
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,000
Can you show me?

856
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:16,667
Sure, if you like.

857
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:20,208
Teach me to ride like a man.

858
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,875
And chew tobacco like a man.

859
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:25,625
And spit like a man.

860
00:54:25,709 --> 00:54:27,625
What, they didn't teach you that\nin finishing school?

861
00:54:27,709 --> 00:54:29,125
No.

862
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:31,208
Well, come on, I'll show you.\nLet's do it.

863
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:33,291
I'll show you how. Come on.

864
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:36,000
-Jack, no! Jack, no!\n-Oh, come on.

865
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:37,583
-Wait, Jack.\n-Come on.

866
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:39,959
No, Jack. I couldn't possibly, Jack.

867
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:41,208
Watch closely.

868
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:45,417
Ugh, that's disgusting!

869
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,333
All right, your turn.

870
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:49,709
That was pitiful!

871
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:51,542
Come on, you really gotta\nhawk it back, you know?

872
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:52,625
Get some leverage to it.

873
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:54,542
Use your arms, arc your neck.

874
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,208
(hawks and spits)

875
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:57,834
See the range on that thing?

876
00:54:57,917 --> 00:54:58,750
Mm-hmm.

877
00:54:58,834 --> 00:55:01,041
-(Rose hawking)\n-JACK: Okay, go.

878
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:03,959
(hawks and spits)

879
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:05,542
Uh, that was better. You gotta work on it.

880
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:06,959
-Really?\n-Really try and hawk it up

881
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:08,333
and get some body to it, you know?

882
00:55:08,417 --> 00:55:10,166
You gotta... (snorting)

883
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:16,125
(swallows)

884
00:55:16,959 --> 00:55:17,959
Mother!

885
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:26,250
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

886
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:28,750
Charmed, I'm sure.

887
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:36,083
ROSE (narrating):\nThe others were gracious and curious

888
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,291
about the man who had saved my life,

889
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:42,458
but my mother looked at him\nlike an insect,

890
00:55:42,542 --> 00:55:47,125
a dangerous insect\nwhich must be squashed quickly.

891
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:50,834
Well, Jack, sounds like you're a good man\nto have around in a sticky spot.

892
00:55:50,917 --> 00:55:54,000
(trumpet playing fanfare)

893
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:57,959
Why do they always insist on announcing\ndinner like a damn cavalry charge?

894
00:55:58,083 --> 00:55:59,083
(laughs)

895
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:00,625
Shall we go dress, Mother?

896
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:03,500
See you at dinner, Jack.

897
00:56:05,834 --> 00:56:06,709
Uh, son?

898
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:08,000
Son!

899
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:11,333
Do you have the slightest comprehension\nwhat you're doing?

900
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:13,208
Not really.

901
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:16,458
Well, you're about to go\ninto the snake pit.

902
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,125
What are you planning to wear?

903
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:24,041
I figured.

904
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:25,333
Come on.

905
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:29,583
I was right.

906
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:31,917
You and my son\nare just about the same size.

907
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,500
Pretty close.

908
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:37,667
(whistles)

909
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,417
You shine up like a new penny.

910
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,709
(laughs)

911
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:53,625
Good evening, sir.

912
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:03,208
(orchestra playing\n"On the Beautiful Blue Danube")

913
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:45,417
Good evening.

914
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:52,542
MAN: Hello.

915
00:57:57,792 --> 00:58:00,083
Do you know that there are\nseveral thousand tons of Hockley steel

916
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:01,083
in this very ship?

917
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:02,000
RUTH: Hmm, which part?

918
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:03,458
CAL: All the right ones, of course.

919
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:05,583
Then we'll know who to hold accountable\nif there's a problem.

920
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:07,792
-Where's my daughter?\n-Oh, she'll be along.

921
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:10,208
There is the Countess.

922
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:11,834
-Hello, my dear.\n-Good evening, Cal.

923
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:13,417
CAL: So good to see you.

924
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:40,917
I saw that in a nickelodeon once

925
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,792
and I always wanted to do it.

926
00:58:51,792 --> 00:58:52,750
(snickers)

927
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:56,834
RUTH: I'll see you at dinner.

928
00:58:56,917 --> 00:58:58,000
Darling?

929
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:01,667
Surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

930
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,792
Dawson?

931
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:03,959
(chuckles)

932
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,750
Well, it's amazing.

933
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,417
You could almost pass for a gentleman.

934
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:10,083
Almost.

935
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:11,208
Extraordinary.

936
00:59:23,583 --> 00:59:26,250
RUTH: My dear,\nit's delightful to see you.

937
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:28,709
What a remarkable voyage this is.\nIt's mad, isn't it?

938
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,542
RUTH: I love your perfume.

939
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:33,166
There's the Countess of Rothes.

940
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:40,750
And, um, that's John Jacob Astor,\nthe richest man on the ship.

941
00:59:40,834 --> 00:59:44,583
His little wifey there, Madeleine,\nis my age and in a delicate condition.

942
00:59:45,709 --> 00:59:47,458
See how she's trying to hide it?

943
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,583
Quite the scandal.

944
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:49,625
Hmm.

945
00:59:49,709 --> 00:59:53,625
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim\nand his mistress Madame Aubert.

946
00:59:53,709 --> 00:59:56,750
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home\nwith the children, of course.

947
00:59:56,834 --> 01:00:00,208
And over here we have Sir Cosmo\nand Lucille Lady Duff-Gordon.

948
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:04,083
She designs naughty lingerie,\namong her many talents.

949
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:06,750
Very popular with the royals.

950
01:00:06,834 --> 01:00:09,542
Congratulations, Hockley. She's splendid.

951
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:11,375
Why, thank you.

952
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:13,583
Care to escort a lady to dinner?

953
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:14,542
Certainly.

954
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:15,917
(chuckling)

955
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:18,542
Sweet pea? Sweet pea.

956
01:00:19,667 --> 01:00:20,917
Ain't nothin' to it, is there, Jack?

957
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,375
Remember, they love money,

958
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:26,083
so just pretend like you own a gold mine,\nand you're in the club.

959
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,291
Hey, Astor!

960
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:32,000
Well, hello, Molly.

961
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,291
Nice to see you.

962
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:34,250
J.J., Madeleine,

963
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:36,166
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

964
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:37,875
-How do you do?\n-Pleasure.

965
01:00:37,959 --> 01:00:38,917
Hello, Jack.

966
01:00:39,834 --> 01:00:41,458
Are you of the Boston Dawsons?

967
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,083
No. The Chippewa Falls Dawsons,\nactually.

968
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:46,375
Oh, yes.

969
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:53,333
ROSE (narrating): He must have\nbeen nervous, but he never faltered.

970
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:55,667
They assumed he was one of them,

971
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:59,333
heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.

972
01:00:59,417 --> 01:01:03,208
New money, obviously,\nbut still a member of the club.

973
01:01:04,291 --> 01:01:07,792
Mother, of course,\ncould always be counted upon.

974
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:11,417
Tell us of the accommodations\nin steerage, Mr. Dawson.

975
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,291
I hear they're quite good on this ship.

976
01:01:14,542 --> 01:01:16,250
The best I've seen, ma'am.

977
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:17,917
Hardly any rats.

978
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,792
(laughing)

979
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:23,750
Mr. Dawson is joining us\nfrom the third class.

980
01:01:23,834 --> 01:01:26,333
He was of some assistance
to my fianc茅e last night.

981
01:01:26,417 --> 01:01:29,417
It turns out that Mr. Dawson\nis quite a fine artist.

982
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,625
He was kind enough to show me\nsome of his work today.

983
01:01:32,709 --> 01:01:35,834
Rose and I differ somewhat\nin our definition of fine art.

984
01:01:35,917 --> 01:01:37,917
Not to impugn your work, sir.

985
01:01:38,917 --> 01:01:40,667
(clears throat)

986
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:45,458
ISMAY: She may be mine on paper,

987
01:01:45,542 --> 01:01:48,500
but in the eyes of God,\nshe belongs to Thomas Andrews.

988
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:49,709
(whispering) Are these all for me?

989
01:01:49,792 --> 01:01:51,917
Just start from the outside\nand work your way in.

990
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,875
He knows every rivet in her,\ndon't you, Thomas?

991
01:01:53,959 --> 01:01:54,834
ANDREWS: Indeed.

992
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:56,750
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews, truly.

993
01:01:56,834 --> 01:01:58,333
Thank you, Rose.

994
01:02:01,166 --> 01:02:03,000
And how do you take your caviar, sir?

995
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:05,041
No caviar for me, thanks.

996
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:06,291
Never did like it much.

997
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:11,041
And where, exactly,\ndo you live, Mr. Dawson?

998
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:14,709
Well, right now, my address\nis the R.M.S. Titanic.

999
01:02:14,792 --> 01:02:16,750
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

1000
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:19,208
And how is it you have means to travel?

1001
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,083
I work my way from place to place,

1002
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:24,542
you know, tramp steamers and such.

1003
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:28,333
But I won my ticket on Titanic here\nat a lucky hand at poker.

1004
01:02:28,417 --> 01:02:30,041
A very lucky hand.

1005
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:32,917
All life is a game of luck.

1006
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,125
Hmm.

1007
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,000
A real man makes his own luck, Archie.

1008
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:37,041
Right, Dawson?

1009
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:38,500
Hmm.

1010
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:42,208
And you find that sort\nof rootless existence appealing, do you?

1011
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:47,208
Well, yes, ma'am, I do.

1012
01:02:47,834 --> 01:02:50,959
I mean, got everything I need\nright here with me.

1013
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:54,000
Got air in my lungs\nand a few blank sheets of paper.

1014
01:02:55,417 --> 01:02:58,500
I mean, I love waking up in the morning\nnot knowing what's gonna happen,

1015
01:02:58,583 --> 01:03:02,208
or who I'm gonna meet,\nwhere I'm gonna wind up.

1016
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:04,583
Just the other night,\nI was sleeping under a bridge,

1017
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:07,208
and now here I am on the grandest ship\nin the world

1018
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:08,667
having champagne with you fine people.

1019
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:09,625
(laughter)

1020
01:03:09,709 --> 01:03:10,667
I'll take some more of that.

1021
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:15,125
I figure life's a gift, and I don't intend\non wasting it.

1022
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:18,709
You never know what hand\nyou're going to get dealt next.

1023
01:03:18,792 --> 01:03:20,834
You learn to take life as it comes at you.

1024
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:21,917
Here you go, Cal.

1025
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:26,083
To make each day count.

1026
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:27,875
Well said, Jack.

1027
01:03:27,959 --> 01:03:29,291
Hear, hear!

1028
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,458
To making it count.

1029
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,333
ALL: To making it count.

1030
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:37,125
ARCHIE: Bravo.

1031
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:42,625
(Molly laughing)

1032
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:46,667
Mr. Brown had no idea I'd hidden the money\nin the stove.

1033
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:50,792
So he comes home\ndrunk as a pig, celebrating,

1034
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:52,709
and he lights a fire.

1035
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:55,500
(laughing)

1036
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:58,375
(softly) Next, it'll be brandies\nin the smoking room.

1037
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:02,583
Well, join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

1038
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:04,458
-What a good idea!\n-Yes.

1039
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:06,041
Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke

1040
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:08,959
and congratulate each other\non being masters of the universe.

1041
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:11,166
Ladies, thank you for the pleasure\nof your company.

1042
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:13,709
Rose, may I escort you back to the cabin?

1043
01:04:13,792 --> 01:04:15,125
No, I'll stay here.

1044
01:04:15,709 --> 01:04:16,834
Here you go, Molly.

1045
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:19,250
ARCHIE: Joining us, Dawson?

1046
01:04:20,417 --> 01:04:22,709
You don't want to stay out here\nwith the women, do you?

1047
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:24,667
No, thanks.\nI've got to be heading back.

1048
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:25,625
Ah.

1049
01:04:25,709 --> 01:04:26,625
Probably best.

1050
01:04:26,709 --> 01:04:29,208
It'll be all business and politics,\nthat sort of thing.

1051
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:30,333
Wouldn't interest you.

1052
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:33,041
But, Dawson,

1053
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:34,291
good of you to come.

1054
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:41,208
Jack, must you go?

1055
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:43,792
Time for me to go row\nwith the other slaves.

1056
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:48,250
Good night, Rose.

1057
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:17,709
(clock chiming)

1058
01:05:18,792 --> 01:05:19,792
(sighs)

1059
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:30,709
So you want to go to a real party?

1060
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,917
(drums pounding, men whooping)

1061
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,959
(lively music playing)

1062
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:43,083
Is okay I put my hand here?

1063
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:44,166
Okay.

1064
01:05:57,792 --> 01:05:59,542
(speaking Swedish)

1065
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:00,500
What?

1066
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:02,875
(repeats Swedish phrase)

1067
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,750
I can't understand you.

1068
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:16,417
(glass shatters)

1069
01:06:30,667 --> 01:06:31,750
Hey!

1070
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:33,041
Bravo, bravo!

1071
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:34,375
Thank you.

1072
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:35,792
Pick it up. Come on, lads,\nlet's go!

1073
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:36,875
(music tempo increases)

1074
01:06:37,709 --> 01:06:39,625
I'm gonna dance with her now, all right?

1075
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:41,250
Come on.

1076
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:42,875
-What?\n-Come on.

1077
01:06:42,959 --> 01:06:46,000
-Come with me.\n-What? Jack... Jack, wait!

1078
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:48,041
(music tempo increases)

1079
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:49,333
I can't do this.

1080
01:06:49,417 --> 01:06:51,250
We're gonna have to\nget a little bit closer.

1081
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:52,458
Like this.

1082
01:06:56,208 --> 01:06:57,834
You're still my best girl, Cora.

1083
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:02,375
I don't know the steps.

1084
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:03,834
Neither do I. Just go with it.

1085
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,875
Don't think.

1086
01:07:06,834 --> 01:07:08,000
(laughing)

1087
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:09,375
Don't think.

1088
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,458
(Rose squealing with delight)

1089
01:07:24,917 --> 01:07:27,250
Wait, Jack, Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!

1090
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,875
(vocalizing)

1091
01:07:33,959 --> 01:07:36,333
(dancers whooping)

1092
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:39,291
Wait!

1093
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:40,834
Hey!

1094
01:08:08,917 --> 01:08:10,083
Woo-hoo!

1095
01:08:19,083 --> 01:08:20,166
JACK: Yeah!

1096
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:22,250
Jack, no!

1097
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:24,792
(yelling)

1098
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:25,834
(squeals)

1099
01:08:25,917 --> 01:08:26,792
(giggling)

1100
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:27,792
(Jack yelling)

1101
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:30,041
...on the jurisdiction of the Sherman Act,

1102
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:31,792
so my lawyers will argue.

1103
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,000
That's what Rockefeller said,

1104
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:35,709
but the Supreme Court\nis not swallowing it.

1105
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:39,166
(men shouting and cheering)

1106
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,375
(lively music playing)

1107
01:08:55,709 --> 01:08:56,667
What?

1108
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,208
You think a first-class girl can't drink?

1109
01:08:59,291 --> 01:09:00,166
(chuckles)

1110
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:01,875
(screams)

1111
01:09:01,959 --> 01:09:02,834
Get out of here.

1112
01:09:02,917 --> 01:09:03,959
You all right?

1113
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:04,959
(laughing)

1114
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,625
(grunts)

1115
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:08,375
-ROSE: I'm fine.\n-(growls)

1116
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:09,709
Two out of three, two out of three.

1117
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:11,917
So...

1118
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:15,750
you think you're big, tough men?

1119
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:18,041
Let's see you do this.

1120
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,083
Hold this for me, Jack.

1121
01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:23,375
Hold it up.

1122
01:09:37,417 --> 01:09:38,542
Ow!

1123
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:39,500
(laughing)

1124
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:42,333
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

1125
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:43,417
You all right?

1126
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,333
I haven't done that in years.

1127
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:55,792
"Drowsy Maggie," lads. Give her a holly!\nLet's go!

1128
01:09:56,375 --> 01:09:57,500
Ho!

1129
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:23,583
Coffee, sir?

1130
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:35,208
I had hoped you would\ncome to me last night.

1131
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:38,834
I was tired.

1132
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,166
Your exertions below decks\nwere no doubt exhausting.

1133
01:10:47,125 --> 01:10:49,417
I see you had that undertaker\nof a manservant follow me.

1134
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,792
How typical.

1135
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:53,083
You will never behave\nlike that again, Rose.

1136
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:54,000
Do you understand?

1137
01:10:57,333 --> 01:11:00,125
I'm not a foreman in one of your mills\nthat you can command.

1138
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,792
I'm your fianc茅e.

1139
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:06,041
My fianc茅e?

1140
01:11:06,125 --> 01:11:07,709
(shouts) My fianc茅e!

1141
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:10,375
Yes, you are, and my wife!

1142
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:15,750
My wife in practice if not yet by law,\nso you will honor me.

1143
01:11:15,834 --> 01:11:18,750
You will honor me the way a wife\nis required to honor a husband

1144
01:11:18,834 --> 01:11:20,959
because I will not be\nmade out a fool, Rose.

1145
01:11:21,917 --> 01:11:23,291
Is this in any way unclear?

1146
01:11:24,709 --> 01:11:26,000
No.

1147
01:11:26,083 --> 01:11:27,417
Good.

1148
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,166
Excuse me.

1149
01:11:32,959 --> 01:11:34,250
(sobbing)

1150
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:36,083
Miss Rose!

1151
01:11:37,417 --> 01:11:39,959
-We had a little... accident.\n-That's all right, Miss Rose.

1152
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:41,709
-I'm sorry, Trudy.\n-It's all right.

1153
01:11:41,792 --> 01:11:43,083
Let me help you.

1154
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:44,875
It's all right, miss.

1155
01:11:47,542 --> 01:11:50,750
(sobbing)

1156
01:11:51,417 --> 01:11:52,959
It's all right, miss.

1157
01:11:58,333 --> 01:11:59,208
Tea, Trudy.

1158
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:01,500
Yes, ma'am.

1159
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:20,083
You're not to see that boy again.\nDo you understand me?

1160
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:24,208
Rose, I forbid it.

1161
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,083
Oh, stop it, Mother.

1162
01:12:26,166 --> 01:12:28,417
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

1163
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,375
This is not a game.

1164
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:32,583
Our situation is precarious.

1165
01:12:32,667 --> 01:12:34,375
You know the money's gone.

1166
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:36,208
Of course I know it's gone.

1167
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:38,583
You remind me every day.

1168
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:43,375
Your father left us nothing but a legacy\nof bad debts

1169
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:44,792
hidden by a good name.

1170
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:47,917
That name is the only card\nwe have to play.

1171
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,542
I don't understand you.

1172
01:12:50,625 --> 01:12:52,583
It is a fine match with Hockley.

1173
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:54,458
It will ensure our survival.

1174
01:12:56,291 --> 01:12:57,875
How can you put this on my shoulders?

1175
01:12:57,959 --> 01:12:59,667
Why are you being so selfish?

1176
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,583
I'm being selfish?

1177
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:08,333
Do you want to see me\nworking as a seamstress?

1178
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:11,709
Is that what you want?

1179
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:17,500
To see our fine things sold at auction?

1180
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,333
Our memories scattered to the winds?

1181
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:32,208
(sighs)

1182
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:34,000
It's so unfair.

1183
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:36,709
Of course it's unfair.

1184
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:39,959
We're women.

1185
01:13:42,041 --> 01:13:44,083
Our choices are never easy.

1186
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:52,750
Hmm?

1187
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:04,083
(people singing\n"Eternal Father, Strong to Save")

1188
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:10,083
Protect them by thy guardian hand

1189
01:14:10,166 --> 01:14:16,542
From every peril on the land

1190
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:21,709
O spirit, whom the Father sent

1191
01:14:21,792 --> 01:14:26,041
To spread across the firmament

1192
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:30,583
O wind of heaven, by thy might

1193
01:14:30,667 --> 01:14:36,000
Save all who dare the eagle's flight

1194
01:14:36,083 --> 01:14:40,166
And keep them by thy watchful...

1195
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,667
Hello, Mr. Andrews.

1196
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:44,917
Hello, Jack.

1197
01:14:53,875 --> 01:14:54,709
Sir...

1198
01:14:54,792 --> 01:14:56,333
I just need to talk to somebody\nfor a second.

1199
01:14:56,417 --> 01:14:59,583
-Sir, you're not supposed to be in here.\n-Just need to speak to someone.

1200
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:01,709
...fire and foe

1201
01:15:01,792 --> 01:15:03,125
Protect them...

1202
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:04,875
I was just here last night.\nYou don't remember me?

1203
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:05,875
No, I'm afraid I don't.

1204
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:08,750
-Now, you're gonna have to turn around.\n-He'll tell you.

1205
01:15:08,834 --> 01:15:10,000
I just... I just need...

1206
01:15:10,083 --> 01:15:13,458
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater

1207
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:16,417
continue to be appreciative\nof your assistance.

1208
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,375
They asked me to, uh,\ngive you this in gratitude.

1209
01:15:20,458 --> 01:15:22,166
I don't want your money. Please, I just...

1210
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:25,291
And also to remind you that you hold\na third-class ticket,

1211
01:15:25,375 --> 01:15:28,333
and that your presence here\nis no longer appropriate.

1212
01:15:28,417 --> 01:15:30,125
Please, I just want\nto speak to Rose for...

1213
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:31,375
Gentlemen, will you please see

1214
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:34,333
that Mr. Dawson gets\nback to where he belongs

1215
01:15:34,417 --> 01:15:35,792
and that he stays there?

1216
01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:37,583
Yes, sir.

1217
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:39,208
Come along, you.

1218
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:44,667
Oh, hear us when we cry to thee

1219
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:50,417
For those in peril on the sea

1220
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,417
RUTH: And why do you have\ntwo steering wheels?

1221
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,291
We really only use this near shore.

1222
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:56,458
Excuse me, sir. Another ice warning.

1223
01:15:56,542 --> 01:15:58,208
This one's from the Noordam.

1224
01:15:58,291 --> 01:15:59,583
Thank you, Sparks.

1225
01:16:01,792 --> 01:16:03,417
Oh, not to worry.

1226
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,083
Quite normal for this time of year.

1227
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:07,500
In fact, we're speeding up.

1228
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:10,166
I've just ordered the last boilers lit.

1229
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:15,959
MAN: Okay, son, wind it up tight\nlike I showed you.

1230
01:16:16,041 --> 01:16:17,208
That's right.

1231
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:18,917
Okay, now, let it go.

1232
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:23,542
-Was good, wasn't it?\n-Quite nice.

1233
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,750
That's excellent, son.

1234
01:16:30,917 --> 01:16:33,166
ROSE: Mr. Andrews, forgive me.

1235
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:36,208
I did the sum in my head,

1236
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:39,875
and with the number of lifeboats\ntimes the capacity you mentioned,

1237
01:16:39,959 --> 01:16:44,083
forgive me, but it seems that there are\nnot enough for everyone aboard.

1238
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:46,000
About half, actually.

1239
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:48,917
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

1240
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:51,917
In fact, I put in these new type davits

1241
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,834
which can take an extra row of boats\ninside this one,

1242
01:16:54,917 --> 01:16:57,709
but it was thought by some

1243
01:16:57,792 --> 01:16:59,250
that the deck would look too cluttered.

1244
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:01,750
So, I was overruled.

1245
01:17:02,458 --> 01:17:05,583
Waste of deck space as it is\non an unsinkable ship.

1246
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:07,375
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

1247
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:10,417
I have built you a good ship,\nstrong and true.

1248
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,250
She's all the lifeboat you need.

1249
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:13,417
Just keep heading aft.

1250
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,041
The next stop will be the engine room.

1251
01:17:15,959 --> 01:17:17,166
Come on.

1252
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:23,375
Jack, this is impossible.

1253
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:25,375
I can't see you.

1254
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:26,375
I need to talk to you.

1255
01:17:26,458 --> 01:17:28,208
No, Jack, no.

1256
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:32,291
Jack, I'm engaged.

1257
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:34,667
I'm marrying Cal.

1258
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:36,959
I love Cal.

1259
01:17:39,375 --> 01:17:42,959
Rose, you're no picnic.

1260
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:45,959
All right?\nYou're a spoiled little brat, even,

1261
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:50,834
but under that you're the most\namazingly astounding

1262
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:53,375
wonderful girl... woman,

1263
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:56,166
-that I've ever known and...\n-Jack, I...

1264
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,709
No, let me try and get this out.

1265
01:17:57,792 --> 01:17:59,709
You're, you're a...

1266
01:18:01,542 --> 01:18:02,834
I'm not an idiot.

1267
01:18:02,917 --> 01:18:04,834
I know how the world works.

1268
01:18:04,917 --> 01:18:06,625
I've got ten bucks in my pocket.

1269
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:09,709
I have nothing to offer you,\nand I know that.

1270
01:18:09,792 --> 01:18:11,291
I understand,

1271
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:14,250
but I'm too involved now.

1272
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:16,625
You jump, I jump, remember?

1273
01:18:16,709 --> 01:18:19,625
I can't turn away without knowing\nyou'll be all right.

1274
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:21,959
That's all that I want.

1275
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,834
Well, I'm fine.

1276
01:18:26,083 --> 01:18:28,333
I'll be fine, really.

1277
01:18:29,709 --> 01:18:30,875
Really?

1278
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,583
I don't think so.

1279
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,792
They've got you trapped, Rose,

1280
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:40,333
and you're gonna die if you don't\nbreak free, maybe not right away

1281
01:18:40,417 --> 01:18:42,208
because you're strong, but...

1282
01:18:43,458 --> 01:18:46,959
sooner or later that fire that I love\nabout you, Rose,

1283
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:49,917
that fire is gonna burn out.

1284
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:56,542
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

1285
01:18:58,792 --> 01:19:00,125
You're right.

1286
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:02,875
Only you can do that.

1287
01:19:09,125 --> 01:19:10,709
I'm going back.

1288
01:19:10,792 --> 01:19:12,458
Leave me alone.

1289
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:16,125
(door closes)

1290
01:19:23,834 --> 01:19:25,542
COUNTESS: Tell Lucille about\nthe disaster you had

1291
01:19:25,625 --> 01:19:26,917
with the stationer's.

1292
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,959
Well, of course, the invitations had to be\nsent back twice.

1293
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:31,417
Oh, my dear!

1294
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,208
And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns,

1295
01:19:33,291 --> 01:19:35,625
let me tell you what an odyssey\nthat has been.

1296
01:19:35,709 --> 01:19:38,208
Rose decided she wanted lavender.

1297
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:40,083
She knows I detest the color,

1298
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:41,917
so she did it only to spite me.

1299
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,208
LUCILLE: If only you'd come to me sooner.

1300
01:19:44,291 --> 01:19:47,458
Ruth saw some of my designs\nin La Mode Illustree.

1301
01:19:47,542 --> 01:19:48,792
They were for the trousseau

1302
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:50,291
of the Duchess of Marlborough's\nyoungest daughter.

1303
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:51,500
They were quite charming,

1304
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:53,166
but I think you'll agree, my dear,

1305
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:57,000
that together we've created\nsomething of a phoenix from the ashes.

1306
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:58,667
(women laughing)

1307
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:13,417
Hello, Jack.

1308
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:21,000
I changed my mind.

1309
01:20:26,667 --> 01:20:28,375
-They said you might be up here...\n-Shh...

1310
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:32,458
Give me your hand.

1311
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:37,583
(refrain from\n"My Heart Will Go On" playing)

1312
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:41,333
Now close your eyes.

1313
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:43,875
Go on.

1314
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:49,208
Step up.

1315
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,208
Now hold on to the railing.

1316
01:20:54,291 --> 01:20:56,083
Keep your eyes closed, don't peek.

1317
01:20:56,166 --> 01:20:57,375
I'm not.

1318
01:20:58,625 --> 01:21:00,250
Step up onto the rail.

1319
01:21:04,792 --> 01:21:05,834
Hold on.

1320
01:21:05,917 --> 01:21:06,792
Hold on.

1321
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:08,083
Keep your eyes closed.

1322
01:21:08,166 --> 01:21:09,166
(giggles)

1323
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:11,125
Do you trust me?

1324
01:21:11,208 --> 01:21:12,834
I trust you.

1325
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:23,959
All right.

1326
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:25,917
Open your eyes.

1327
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:28,125
(gasps)

1328
01:21:32,291 --> 01:21:33,625
I'm flying!

1329
01:21:33,709 --> 01:21:34,667
Jack!

1330
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:03,375
(softly) Come, Josephine\nMy flying machine

1331
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:08,458
Going up, she goes, up, she goes...

1332
01:22:49,667 --> 01:22:51,834
(indistinct radio chatter)

1333
01:22:55,792 --> 01:22:59,125
That was the last time Titanic\never saw daylight.

1334
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:03,291
So we're up to dusk\nthe night of the sinking.

1335
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:04,834
Six hours to go.

1336
01:23:04,917 --> 01:23:05,959
Incredible.

1337
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:07,375
There's Smith and he's standing there,

1338
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:09,583
and he's got the iceberg warning\nin his fucking hand,

1339
01:23:09,667 --> 01:23:11,083
excuse me, his hand

1340
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:12,875
and he's ordering more speed.

1341
01:23:12,959 --> 01:23:15,458
Twenty-six years of experience\nworking against him.

1342
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:18,417
He figures anything big enough\nto sink the ship,

1343
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,583
they're gonna see in time to turn,

1344
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:23,709
but the ship's too big\nwith too small a rudder.

1345
01:23:23,792 --> 01:23:25,333
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1346
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:28,959
Everything he knows is wrong.

1347
01:23:41,333 --> 01:23:43,417
(laughing) It's quite proper,\nI assure you.

1348
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,125
This is the sitting room.

1349
01:23:47,291 --> 01:23:48,458
Will this light do?

1350
01:23:48,542 --> 01:23:49,417
What?

1351
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,750
Don't artists need good light?

1352
01:23:51,834 --> 01:23:53,875
(in French accent) That is true,\nbut I'm not used to working

1353
01:23:53,959 --> 01:23:55,834
in such horrible conditions.

1354
01:23:56,959 --> 01:23:58,291
Monet!

1355
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,625
ROSE: Do you know his work?

1356
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:02,500
Of course.

1357
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:03,792
Look at his use of color here.

1358
01:24:03,875 --> 01:24:04,709
Isn't he great?

1359
01:24:04,792 --> 01:24:06,333
ROSE: I know, it's extraordinary.

1360
01:24:08,959 --> 01:24:12,166
Cal insists on carting\nthis hideous thing everywhere.

1361
01:24:13,166 --> 01:24:15,500
Should we be expecting him anytime soon?

1362
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:19,583
Not as long as the cigars\nand brandy hold out.

1363
01:24:22,959 --> 01:24:23,834
That's nice.

1364
01:24:24,667 --> 01:24:26,041
What is it, a sapphire?

1365
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:30,291
A diamond, a very rare diamond.

1366
01:24:30,625 --> 01:24:31,542
Phew.

1367
01:24:33,959 --> 01:24:36,667
Jack, I want you to draw me\nlike one of your French girls...

1368
01:24:37,792 --> 01:24:39,583
wearing this.

1369
01:24:39,667 --> 01:24:40,792
All right.

1370
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,500
Wearing only this.

1371
01:25:19,667 --> 01:25:21,083
The last thing I need

1372
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:23,875
is another picture of me\nlooking like a porcelain doll.

1373
01:25:27,834 --> 01:25:28,875
As a paying customer,

1374
01:25:31,375 --> 01:25:33,709
I expect to get what I want.

1375
01:25:51,417 --> 01:25:54,375
Over, um, the bed... The couch.

1376
01:26:02,959 --> 01:26:04,500
Go, lie down.

1377
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:09,417
-Yeah...\n-Tell me when it looks right.

1378
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,166
Put your arm back the way it was.

1379
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:13,667
Right.

1380
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:17,458
Put that other arm up, that hand,\nright by your face there.

1381
01:26:18,875 --> 01:26:19,750
Right.

1382
01:26:20,667 --> 01:26:23,250
Now, head down...

1383
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:26,750
Eyes to me, keep 'em on me.

1384
01:26:29,291 --> 01:26:30,709
And try to stay still.

1385
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:34,417
(clears throat)

1386
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:36,458
(exhales)

1387
01:26:50,083 --> 01:26:51,583
So serious.

1388
01:27:33,542 --> 01:27:36,583
I believe you are blushing,\nMr. Big Artiste.

1389
01:27:40,917 --> 01:27:43,625
I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.

1390
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:47,041
He does landscapes.

1391
01:27:47,125 --> 01:27:48,959
Just relax your face.

1392
01:27:49,041 --> 01:27:49,875
Sorry.

1393
01:27:49,959 --> 01:27:51,250
No laughing.

1394
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:53,375
(breathes deeply)

1395
01:27:58,625 --> 01:28:01,500
("My Heart Will Go On" playing on piano)

1396
01:28:22,417 --> 01:28:25,709
My heart was pounding the whole time.

1397
01:28:25,792 --> 01:28:29,875
It was the most erotic moment of my life.

1398
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:35,583
Up until then, at least.

1399
01:28:36,375 --> 01:28:38,208
So what happened next?

1400
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:41,709
You mean, did we do it?

1401
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:46,625
Sorry, to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.

1402
01:28:46,709 --> 01:28:49,667
Jack was very professional.

1403
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,166
(blows)

1404
01:28:57,417 --> 01:28:58,834
Thank you.

1405
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:03,166
(Rose laughing)

1406
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:08,000
What you doing?

1407
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:10,667
Will you put this back in the safe for me?

1408
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:11,917
Mm-hmm.

1409
01:29:17,834 --> 01:29:18,750
Phew.

1410
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:24,917
Gentlemen, would you excuse me?

1411
01:29:27,834 --> 01:29:29,792
None of the stewards have seen her.

1412
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,166
This is absurd.

1413
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:35,709
It's a ship. There's only so many places\nshe could be.

1414
01:29:35,792 --> 01:29:37,667
Lovejoy, find her.

1415
01:29:54,709 --> 01:29:55,542
Clear.

1416
01:29:55,625 --> 01:29:56,834
Yes.

1417
01:29:57,875 --> 01:30:01,583
I don't think I've ever seen\nsuch a flat calm.

1418
01:30:01,667 --> 01:30:03,125
Like a mill pond.

1419
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:05,834
Not a breath of wind.

1420
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:09,834
It will make the bergs harder to see

1421
01:30:09,917 --> 01:30:12,500
with no breaking water at the base.

1422
01:30:14,667 --> 01:30:15,625
Hmm.

1423
01:30:23,709 --> 01:30:25,125
Well, I'm off.

1424
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:28,125
Maintain speed and heading,\nMr. Lightoller.

1425
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:29,500
Yes, sir.

1426
01:30:41,166 --> 01:30:42,417
It's getting cold.

1427
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:43,417
You look nice.

1428
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:44,333
(knocking on door)

1429
01:30:44,417 --> 01:30:45,750
LOVEJOY: Miss Rose?

1430
01:30:45,834 --> 01:30:47,000
My drawings!

1431
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,250
(door closes)

1432
01:31:13,333 --> 01:31:14,500
Come on!

1433
01:31:17,792 --> 01:31:19,208
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait!

1434
01:31:19,291 --> 01:31:20,583
Wait, wait, wait!

1435
01:31:21,458 --> 01:31:23,542
Go, go! Down, down!

1436
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:24,709
ROSE: Quickly, quickly!

1437
01:31:29,625 --> 01:31:30,500
(laughs)

1438
01:31:30,583 --> 01:31:31,834
Bye!

1439
01:31:39,333 --> 01:31:40,208
Sorry!

1440
01:31:40,291 --> 01:31:41,750
(laughing)

1441
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:47,750
It's all right, sir. I've got it.

1442
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:50,583
(laughing)

1443
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:00,500
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

1444
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:02,166
Seems more like a cop.

1445
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:03,417
I think he was.

1446
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:05,792
-JACK: Oh, shit!\n-ROSE: Go!

1447
01:32:07,542 --> 01:32:08,375
Come on.

1448
01:32:10,375 --> 01:32:11,667
No, over here!

1449
01:32:12,667 --> 01:32:13,750
Quick!

1450
01:32:17,041 --> 01:32:20,166
(boiler blasting)

1451
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:21,834
(shouting) Now what?

1452
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:23,125
(shouts) What?

1453
01:32:30,583 --> 01:32:31,875
Hold up!

1454
01:32:31,959 --> 01:32:33,041
What're you two doing down here?

1455
01:32:33,125 --> 01:32:35,959
You shouldn't be down here!\nIt could be dangerous! Oi!

1456
01:32:40,417 --> 01:32:41,250
JACK: Carry on!

1457
01:32:41,333 --> 01:32:43,583
Don't mind us, you're doing a great job!

1458
01:32:43,667 --> 01:32:44,875
Keep up the good work!

1459
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:03,625
Ah, look what we have here, huh?

1460
01:33:14,709 --> 01:33:15,875
(Rose clears throat)

1461
01:33:18,417 --> 01:33:19,417
(clears throat)

1462
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,417
Thank you.

1463
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:34,750
(honks horn)

1464
01:33:34,834 --> 01:33:36,417
Where to, miss?

1465
01:33:37,792 --> 01:33:39,208
To the stars.

1466
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,875
You nervous?

1467
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,500
No.

1468
01:34:20,375 --> 01:34:22,375
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1469
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:48,208
CREWMAN: God, it's bloody cold.

1470
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:50,542
You know, I can smell ice, you know,

1471
01:34:50,625 --> 01:34:52,166
when it's near.

1472
01:34:53,208 --> 01:34:54,959
Bollocks.

1473
01:34:55,041 --> 01:34:56,375
But I can, all right!

1474
01:34:57,125 --> 01:34:59,083
Did you ever find those binoculars\nfor the lookouts?

1475
01:34:59,166 --> 01:35:01,041
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1476
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:03,917
Well, I'll be on my rounds.

1477
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,083
Cheerio.

1478
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:27,750
(breathing heavily)

1479
01:35:36,417 --> 01:35:37,792
You're trembling.

1480
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,583
Don't worry, I'll be all right.

1481
01:35:56,792 --> 01:36:00,166
(breathing heavily)

1482
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,417
They ran down there.

1483
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:06,834
Right.

1484
01:36:15,959 --> 01:36:17,542
LOVEJOY: Anything missing?

1485
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:38,458
(exclaims)

1486
01:36:42,917 --> 01:36:44,375
I've got a better idea.

1487
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:58,500
Gotcha!

1488
01:37:00,333 --> 01:37:03,917
(Rose laughing)

1489
01:37:05,875 --> 01:37:07,917
(both laughing)

1490
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,709
Did you see those guys' faces?

1491
01:37:11,542 --> 01:37:13,291
Did you see the...

1492
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:20,959
When the ship docks,

1493
01:37:22,542 --> 01:37:24,542
I'm getting off with you.

1494
01:37:25,375 --> 01:37:26,875
This is crazy.

1495
01:37:26,959 --> 01:37:28,041
I know.

1496
01:37:28,125 --> 01:37:29,875
It doesn't make any sense.

1497
01:37:31,333 --> 01:37:32,875
That's why I trust it.

1498
01:37:41,792 --> 01:37:43,208
(quietly) Oh, yes.

1499
01:37:43,291 --> 01:37:44,625
Here, look at this.

1500
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,542
Oh, look at that, would you?

1501
01:37:47,625 --> 01:37:49,041
They're a bit warmer than we are.

1502
01:37:49,625 --> 01:37:52,125
Well, if that's what it takes\nfor us to get warmer, I'd rather not,

1503
01:37:52,208 --> 01:37:53,917
if it's all the same to you, all right?

1504
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:07,750
Bugger me!

1505
01:38:07,834 --> 01:38:09,542
(alarm bell clanging)

1506
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:12,583
(telephone ringing)

1507
01:38:12,667 --> 01:38:14,625
Pick up, you bastards!

1508
01:38:14,709 --> 01:38:18,166
(ringing continues)

1509
01:38:18,250 --> 01:38:19,375
LOOKOUT: Is there anyone there?

1510
01:38:19,458 --> 01:38:20,667
Yes, what do you see?

1511
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:22,417
Iceberg! Right ahead!

1512
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:23,333
Thank you.

1513
01:38:26,166 --> 01:38:27,000
Iceberg! Right ahead!

1514
01:38:27,083 --> 01:38:27,917
Hard to starboard!

1515
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,625
CREWMAN: Hard to starboard!

1516
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:35,750
(ringing)

1517
01:38:35,834 --> 01:38:38,333
CREWMAN: Turn, turn! Steady!

1518
01:38:39,417 --> 01:38:40,291
(ringing)

1519
01:38:40,375 --> 01:38:41,750
(bell clangs)

1520
01:38:43,792 --> 01:38:44,667
Full astern!

1521
01:38:46,792 --> 01:38:47,792
Hard over.

1522
01:38:47,875 --> 01:38:49,625
Helm's hard over, sir.

1523
01:38:51,583 --> 01:38:53,291
(ringing)

1524
01:38:53,375 --> 01:38:55,291
Go, lads! Go!

1525
01:38:57,333 --> 01:38:59,500
(men yelling out orders)

1526
01:39:01,792 --> 01:39:03,667
Shut all the dampers!

1527
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:04,834
Shut them!

1528
01:39:05,709 --> 01:39:07,625
(dampers slamming)

1529
01:39:09,625 --> 01:39:10,542
Hold it.

1530
01:39:12,291 --> 01:39:13,542
Hold it!

1531
01:39:14,834 --> 01:39:16,792
Now, engage the reversing engine!

1532
01:39:21,417 --> 01:39:24,000
(engine stops)

1533
01:39:26,667 --> 01:39:30,709
(engine restarting)

1534
01:39:45,834 --> 01:39:47,208
Why aren't they turning?

1535
01:39:47,291 --> 01:39:48,625
Is it hard over?

1536
01:39:48,709 --> 01:39:50,291
It is, yes, sir! Hard over!

1537
01:39:54,458 --> 01:39:58,125
(softly) Come on, come on, come on.

1538
01:39:58,208 --> 01:39:59,875
Turn.

1539
01:40:10,208 --> 01:40:11,500
Yes...

1540
01:40:16,834 --> 01:40:18,125
It's gonna hit!

1541
01:40:29,875 --> 01:40:31,125
Jesus Christ.

1542
01:40:45,083 --> 01:40:47,709
(glass tinkling)

1543
01:40:51,458 --> 01:40:53,208
(softly) Jesus.

1544
01:40:53,291 --> 01:40:54,583
Hard to port!

1545
01:40:54,667 --> 01:40:56,000
CREWMAN: Hard to port!

1546
01:40:59,834 --> 01:41:01,583
(men screaming)

1547
01:41:06,208 --> 01:41:07,291
Get back!

1548
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:22,250
(screaming)

1549
01:41:25,417 --> 01:41:26,458
(hissing)

1550
01:41:26,542 --> 01:41:27,542
(screams)

1551
01:41:34,792 --> 01:41:36,750
(metal doors closing)

1552
01:41:36,834 --> 01:41:37,750
Come on, let's go!

1553
01:41:37,834 --> 01:41:40,208
Get out the door!\nThey're closing the doors!

1554
01:41:40,291 --> 01:41:41,834
Get out!

1555
01:41:41,917 --> 01:41:42,917
Get out!

1556
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,208
Get out! Get out!

1557
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:49,709
Get out the door!

1558
01:41:49,792 --> 01:41:50,750
Go on!

1559
01:41:50,834 --> 01:41:52,625
Go on! Come on, lads!

1560
01:41:52,709 --> 01:41:54,000
Go, lads, go!

1561
01:42:01,583 --> 01:42:02,667
Get out!

1562
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:07,834
(screams)

1563
01:42:22,166 --> 01:42:23,917
(softly) Oh, my God.

1564
01:42:24,667 --> 01:42:26,291
That was a close shave, wasn't it?

1565
01:42:26,375 --> 01:42:28,000
Smell ice, can you?

1566
01:42:28,083 --> 01:42:29,667
Bleeding Christ.

1567
01:42:33,917 --> 01:42:36,375
Note the time and enter it in the log.

1568
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1569
01:42:44,083 --> 01:42:46,333
An iceberg, sir.

1570
01:42:47,458 --> 01:42:48,750
I put her hard to starboard

1571
01:42:48,834 --> 01:42:50,875
and ran the engines full astern,\nbut it was too close.

1572
01:42:50,959 --> 01:42:53,583
I tried to port round it\nbut she hit and the--

1573
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:55,125
Close the watertight doors.

1574
01:42:55,208 --> 01:42:56,709
MURDOCH: The doors are closed, sir.

1575
01:42:59,959 --> 01:43:02,041
-All stop.\n-Aye, sir.

1576
01:43:04,583 --> 01:43:06,709
(ringing)

1577
01:43:10,625 --> 01:43:12,250
Find the carpenter.\nGet him to sound the ship.

1578
01:43:12,333 --> 01:43:13,250
Yes, sir!

1579
01:43:16,458 --> 01:43:19,875
(cursing in Italian)

1580
01:43:24,125 --> 01:43:26,333
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!

1581
01:43:26,417 --> 01:43:27,667
Come on, hurry up.

1582
01:43:32,458 --> 01:43:34,667
Excuse me. Why have the engines stopped?

1583
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:35,625
I felt a shudder.

1584
01:43:35,709 --> 01:43:38,375
I shouldn't worry, madam.\nWe've likely thrown a propeller blade.

1585
01:43:38,458 --> 01:43:39,417
That's the shudder you felt.

1586
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:40,667
May I bring you anything?

1587
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:43,291
No, thank you.

1588
01:43:48,333 --> 01:43:50,250
MAN: So, haven't spotted an iceberg.\nDid you see anything?

1589
01:43:50,333 --> 01:43:52,875
I don't see anything now, do you?

1590
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:56,417
If this is the direction\nthe rats are going,

1591
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:57,667
that's good enough for me.

1592
01:43:59,959 --> 01:44:01,166
CREWMAN: Please, sir, please.

1593
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:02,333
Everything's under control.

1594
01:44:05,041 --> 01:44:05,875
You there.

1595
01:44:05,959 --> 01:44:07,000
Sir, there is no emergency.

1596
01:44:07,083 --> 01:44:08,709
Yes, there is. I have been robbed.

1597
01:44:08,792 --> 01:44:09,875
Get the master-at-arms.

1598
01:44:09,959 --> 01:44:11,333
(yells) Now, you moron!

1599
01:44:11,417 --> 01:44:12,417
Yes, sir.

1600
01:44:13,041 --> 01:44:15,083
(men laughing)

1601
01:44:15,917 --> 01:44:17,792
Hey, you're gonna miss the fun.

1602
01:44:19,208 --> 01:44:20,166
Did you see what happened?

1603
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:21,208
No, I missed it.

1604
01:44:21,291 --> 01:44:22,583
Apparently, it hit over there.

1605
01:44:24,041 --> 01:44:26,250
CREWMAN: Boiler room six is flooded\neight feet above the plate,

1606
01:44:26,333 --> 01:44:27,500
and the mail hold is worse.

1607
01:44:27,583 --> 01:44:28,959
She's all buckled in in the forward hull.

1608
01:44:29,041 --> 01:44:31,125
-Can you shore up?\n-Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1609
01:44:31,208 --> 01:44:32,667
Have you seen the damage in the mail hold?

1610
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:34,166
No, she's already underwater.

1611
01:44:34,917 --> 01:44:36,041
This is bad.

1612
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,542
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1613
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:43,291
I think they're very good, sir.

1614
01:44:46,667 --> 01:44:47,875
Don't touch anything.

1615
01:44:47,959 --> 01:44:49,667
I want the entire room photographed.

1616
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:51,542
ROSE: Just keep holding my hand.

1617
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:56,458
We've been looking for you, miss.

1618
01:45:00,959 --> 01:45:02,542
ROSE (sighs): Well, here we go.

1619
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:09,792
Something serious has happened.

1620
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:12,875
Yes, it has.

1621
01:45:14,417 --> 01:45:17,667
Indeed. Two things dear to me\nhave disappeared this evening.

1622
01:45:18,250 --> 01:45:19,583
Now that one is back,

1623
01:45:19,667 --> 01:45:21,542
I have a pretty good idea\nwhere to find the other.

1624
01:45:21,625 --> 01:45:22,709
Search him.

1625
01:45:22,792 --> 01:45:23,750
Take your coat off, son.

1626
01:45:23,834 --> 01:45:24,709
-Now what?\n-Come on then.

1627
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:27,625
Cal, what are you doing?

1628
01:45:27,709 --> 01:45:29,000
We're in the middle of an emergency.

1629
01:45:29,083 --> 01:45:29,959
What's going on?

1630
01:45:30,041 --> 01:45:31,208
Is this it?

1631
01:45:31,291 --> 01:45:32,166
That's it.

1632
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:34,458
This is horseshit!

1633
01:45:35,333 --> 01:45:36,750
Don't you believe it, Rose.

1634
01:45:36,834 --> 01:45:37,667
Don't!

1635
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:39,333
-He couldn't have.\n-Of course he could.

1636
01:45:39,417 --> 01:45:41,041
It's easy enough for a professional.

1637
01:45:41,125 --> 01:45:42,291
But I was with him the whole time.

1638
01:45:42,375 --> 01:45:43,417
This is absurd.

1639
01:45:44,083 --> 01:45:46,875
Perhaps he did it while you were putting\nyour clothes back on, dear.

1640
01:45:48,583 --> 01:45:50,792
Real slick, Cal.\nRose, they put it in my pocket.

1641
01:45:50,875 --> 01:45:51,709
Shut up.

1642
01:45:51,792 --> 01:45:53,333
It isn't even your pocket, is it, son?

1643
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,625
Property of A.L. Ryerson.

1644
01:45:59,917 --> 01:46:01,417
That was reported stolen today.

1645
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:02,333
I just borrowed it.

1646
01:46:02,417 --> 01:46:03,458
I was gonna return it.

1647
01:46:03,542 --> 01:46:05,542
Oh, an honest thief.\nWe have an honest thief here, do we?

1648
01:46:06,166 --> 01:46:08,458
You know I didn't do this, Rose.\nYou know it!

1649
01:46:09,375 --> 01:46:10,375
Don't you believe them, Rose.

1650
01:46:10,458 --> 01:46:11,875
You know it. You know I didn't do it.

1651
01:46:11,959 --> 01:46:12,834
Come on, son, let's go.

1652
01:46:12,917 --> 01:46:14,542
You know I didn't do it, Rose. Rose!

1653
01:46:14,625 --> 01:46:15,959
Come on. There's a good lad.

1654
01:46:16,041 --> 01:46:17,166
Come on, son. There's a good lad.

1655
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:18,333
Come on!

1656
01:46:18,417 --> 01:46:19,625
You know I didn't do it!

1657
01:46:19,709 --> 01:46:20,709
You know me!

1658
01:46:22,583 --> 01:46:24,750
ISMAY: Most unfortunate, Captain.

1659
01:46:28,291 --> 01:46:31,667
Water, 14 feet above the keel\nin ten minutes,

1660
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:32,792
in the forepeak,

1661
01:46:32,875 --> 01:46:35,250
in all three holds and in boiler room six.

1662
01:46:35,333 --> 01:46:36,250
That's right, sir.

1663
01:46:36,333 --> 01:46:38,125
When can we get under way, damn it?

1664
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:40,250
That's five compartments.

1665
01:46:42,208 --> 01:46:43,083
She can stay afloat

1666
01:46:43,166 --> 01:46:45,959
with the first four compartments breached,\nbut not five.

1667
01:46:46,834 --> 01:46:48,333
Not five.

1668
01:46:48,417 --> 01:46:49,750
As she goes down by the head,

1669
01:46:49,834 --> 01:46:52,250
the water will spill\nover the tops of the bulkheads

1670
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:55,041
at "E" deck from one to the next.

1671
01:46:55,125 --> 01:46:56,208
Back and back.

1672
01:46:56,291 --> 01:46:58,000
There's no stopping it.

1673
01:46:58,083 --> 01:46:59,000
The pumps.

1674
01:46:59,083 --> 01:47:02,917
-If we opened the doors...\n-The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.

1675
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,458
From this moment no matter what we do,

1676
01:47:06,709 --> 01:47:08,458
Titanic will founder.

1677
01:47:11,125 --> 01:47:12,625
But this ship can't sink.

1678
01:47:12,709 --> 01:47:13,875
She's made of iron, sir.

1679
01:47:13,959 --> 01:47:14,875
I assure you, she can...

1680
01:47:15,875 --> 01:47:17,125
and she will.

1681
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,875
It is a mathematical certainty.

1682
01:47:24,458 --> 01:47:25,917
How much time?

1683
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:34,375
An hour.

1684
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:35,959
Two at most.

1685
01:47:41,834 --> 01:47:43,875
And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1686
01:47:44,333 --> 01:47:47,041
2,200 souls on board, sir.

1687
01:47:54,333 --> 01:47:57,291
Well, I believe you may get\nyour headlines, Mr. Ismay.

1688
01:48:15,083 --> 01:48:16,583
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1689
01:48:17,917 --> 01:48:19,417
Will you look at me\nwhen I'm talking to you.

1690
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:20,583
(knocking on door)

1691
01:48:20,667 --> 01:48:21,500
Mr. Hockley?

1692
01:48:21,583 --> 01:48:22,875
Not now! We are busy.

1693
01:48:22,959 --> 01:48:25,834
Sir, I've been told to ask you\nto please put on your lifebelts

1694
01:48:25,917 --> 01:48:27,667
-and come up to the--\n-I said not now.

1695
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:29,417
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,\nMr. Hockley,

1696
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:30,875
but it's Captain's orders.

1697
01:48:30,959 --> 01:48:33,083
Now, please, dress warmly.

1698
01:48:33,166 --> 01:48:34,834
It's quite cold out tonight.

1699
01:48:35,583 --> 01:48:38,792
Now, may I suggest topcoats and hats.

1700
01:48:38,875 --> 01:48:40,083
This is ridiculous.

1701
01:48:41,291 --> 01:48:42,834
Not to worry, miss.

1702
01:48:42,917 --> 01:48:45,166
I am sure it's just a precaution.

1703
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:46,166
Everybody up!

1704
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:47,458
Lifebelts on!

1705
01:48:47,542 --> 01:48:49,000
(men screaming orders)

1706
01:48:49,083 --> 01:48:50,625
What? What's he yelling about?

1707
01:48:50,709 --> 01:48:52,542
Everybody up! Put your lifebelts on!

1708
01:48:52,625 --> 01:48:53,542
What's the ruckus?

1709
01:48:53,625 --> 01:48:54,959
Just put your lifebelts on!

1710
01:48:56,041 --> 01:48:57,500
CREWMAN: C.Q.D.?

1711
01:48:58,083 --> 01:48:59,125
Sir?

1712
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,458
That's right. C.Q.D. The distress call.

1713
01:49:03,542 --> 01:49:04,792
That's our position.

1714
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:09,834
(sighs)

1715
01:49:09,917 --> 01:49:12,792
Tell whoever responds\nthat we're going down by the head,

1716
01:49:12,875 --> 01:49:14,667
and need immediate assistance.

1717
01:49:24,041 --> 01:49:25,208
Blimey.

1718
01:49:35,542 --> 01:49:36,792
Keep lowering!

1719
01:49:37,709 --> 01:49:38,959
Keep lowering!

1720
01:49:44,667 --> 01:49:47,625
Make it fast!

1721
01:49:57,458 --> 01:49:59,250
Roll back that cover!

1722
01:49:59,333 --> 01:50:00,333
Mr. Wilde!

1723
01:50:00,417 --> 01:50:02,375
Mr. Wilde, where are the passengers?

1724
01:50:02,458 --> 01:50:03,792
They've all gone back inside.

1725
01:50:03,875 --> 01:50:05,959
It's too damn cold and noisy for them.

1726
01:50:06,041 --> 01:50:07,291
You there!

1727
01:50:07,375 --> 01:50:08,375
(blows whistle)

1728
01:50:08,458 --> 01:50:10,709
Get down here and help with these lines.

1729
01:50:10,792 --> 01:50:13,792
(orchestra playing\n"Alexander's Ragtime Band")

1730
01:50:17,333 --> 01:50:19,875
(people talking indistinctly)

1731
01:50:24,917 --> 01:50:26,500
Care for a drink, sir?

1732
01:50:28,667 --> 01:50:30,959
-CREWMAN: Please put your lifebelts on.\n-Hey, sonny, what's doing?

1733
01:50:31,041 --> 01:50:32,333
You got us all trussed up here,

1734
01:50:32,417 --> 01:50:34,250
and now we're cooling our heels.

1735
01:50:34,333 --> 01:50:36,500
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go and find out.

1736
01:50:37,041 --> 01:50:39,834
I don't think anybody knows\nwhat the hell's going on around here.

1737
01:50:39,917 --> 01:50:42,542
It's the goddamned English\ndoing everything by the book.

1738
01:50:42,625 --> 01:50:46,083
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.

1739
01:50:46,166 --> 01:50:48,208
Go back and turn\nthe heaters on in our rooms.

1740
01:50:48,291 --> 01:50:50,417
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.

1741
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:51,917
Yes, ma'am.

1742
01:51:01,667 --> 01:51:02,750
Mr. Andrews.

1743
01:51:04,959 --> 01:51:05,875
I saw the iceberg,

1744
01:51:05,959 --> 01:51:08,250
and I see it in your eyes.

1745
01:51:08,333 --> 01:51:09,959
Please tell me the truth.

1746
01:51:18,208 --> 01:51:20,041
The ship will sink.

1747
01:51:21,875 --> 01:51:22,750
You're certain?

1748
01:51:22,834 --> 01:51:25,041
Yes, in an hour or so.

1749
01:51:26,166 --> 01:51:28,625
All this will be at the bottom\nof the Atlantic.

1750
01:51:30,291 --> 01:51:31,583
What?

1751
01:51:31,667 --> 01:51:33,375
Please, tell only who you must.

1752
01:51:33,458 --> 01:51:35,834
I don't want to be responsible\nfor a panic,

1753
01:51:35,917 --> 01:51:39,417
and get to a boat quickly, don't wait.

1754
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:42,083
You remember what I told you\nabout the boats?

1755
01:51:45,208 --> 01:51:46,625
Yes.

1756
01:51:48,625 --> 01:51:49,917
I understand.

1757
01:51:57,834 --> 01:51:59,166
Over here, son.

1758
01:52:00,125 --> 01:52:02,875
Sir, they need you up in the second-class\npurser's office.

1759
01:52:02,959 --> 01:52:03,834
There's a big mob up there.

1760
01:52:03,917 --> 01:52:05,583
Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.

1761
01:52:05,667 --> 01:52:07,458
Aye, right.

1762
01:52:21,875 --> 01:52:22,917
Sir!

1763
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,375
Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.

1764
01:52:25,458 --> 01:52:27,458
Full steam for them, sir.

1765
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:30,458
She's the only one who's responding?

1766
01:52:30,542 --> 01:52:32,041
The only one close, sir.

1767
01:52:32,125 --> 01:52:34,125
She says they can be here in four hours.

1768
01:52:34,667 --> 01:52:35,875
Four hours?

1769
01:52:41,375 --> 01:52:42,750
Thank you, Bride.

1770
01:52:47,291 --> 01:52:48,458
My God.

1771
01:52:49,834 --> 01:52:53,750
(crewmen yelling out orders)

1772
01:52:57,208 --> 01:52:58,125
Sir!

1773
01:52:58,208 --> 01:53:00,750
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1774
01:53:02,041 --> 01:53:05,417
Hadn't we better get the women\nand children into the boats, sir?

1775
01:53:07,625 --> 01:53:08,959
Yes, we...

1776
01:53:09,041 --> 01:53:10,333
Sir?

1777
01:53:13,083 --> 01:53:15,291
Women and children first.

1778
01:53:15,375 --> 01:53:16,291
Yes...

1779
01:53:17,333 --> 01:53:18,375
Yes, sir.

1780
01:53:21,917 --> 01:53:23,458
LIGHTOLLER (shouting):\nLadies and gentlemen,

1781
01:53:23,542 --> 01:53:24,750
your attention, please!

1782
01:53:24,834 --> 01:53:26,375
Step this way, please.

1783
01:53:26,458 --> 01:53:27,458
That's right.

1784
01:53:27,542 --> 01:53:29,250
Come towards me.

1785
01:53:29,333 --> 01:53:30,625
Thank you.

1786
01:53:31,709 --> 01:53:32,709
Good.

1787
01:53:32,792 --> 01:53:37,250
For the time being, I shall require\nonly women and children.

1788
01:53:37,333 --> 01:53:38,542
MAN: Right here.

1789
01:53:39,333 --> 01:53:41,083
All right, boys, like the Captain said,

1790
01:53:41,166 --> 01:53:43,166
nice and cheery so there's no panic.

1791
01:53:44,333 --> 01:53:46,166
"Wedding Dance."

1792
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:49,959
(orchestra begins playing)

1793
01:53:54,041 --> 01:53:55,125
Lifebelts on!

1794
01:53:55,208 --> 01:53:57,041
Here, put your lifebelts on.

1795
01:53:57,125 --> 01:53:58,500
Put your lifebelts on.

1796
01:53:58,583 --> 01:53:59,750
Here, put your lifebelt on.

1797
01:53:59,834 --> 01:54:01,125
Here, come on, here.

1798
01:54:05,709 --> 01:54:07,834
(men talking indistinctly)

1799
01:54:07,917 --> 01:54:10,834
STEWARD: It isn't time to go up\nto the boats yet.

1800
01:54:10,917 --> 01:54:12,959
Please stay calm.

1801
01:54:13,041 --> 01:54:16,417
Look, please, make sure\neverybody you've got your lifebelts on

1802
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,166
and, gentlemen, allow the women\nand children through to the front.

1803
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:20,625
What are we doing, Mommy?

1804
01:54:20,709 --> 01:54:21,959
We're just waiting, dear.

1805
01:54:22,083 --> 01:54:24,291
When they're finished putting\nthe first-class people in the boats,

1806
01:54:24,375 --> 01:54:27,458
they'll be starting with us\nand we'll want to be all ready, won't we?

1807
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:30,625
(men arguing)

1808
01:54:31,417 --> 01:54:32,792
Go and get some help.

1809
01:54:32,875 --> 01:54:35,959
Lower away! Left and right together!

1810
01:54:36,041 --> 01:54:37,125
Steady!

1811
01:54:37,208 --> 01:54:39,333
Both sides together!

1812
01:54:39,417 --> 01:54:40,792
Steady!

1813
01:54:40,875 --> 01:54:42,250
Steady!

1814
01:54:42,333 --> 01:54:44,083
Steady!

1815
01:54:45,375 --> 01:54:46,667
Stop! Stop!

1816
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:48,041
(screaming)

1817
01:54:48,125 --> 01:54:49,417
Hold the left side!

1818
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:52,333
Right side only! Right side only!

1819
01:54:52,417 --> 01:54:53,792
Right side only!

1820
01:54:53,875 --> 01:54:55,125
Hold the left side!

1821
01:54:55,208 --> 01:54:56,458
Right side down!

1822
01:54:56,542 --> 01:54:57,875
Lower away together!

1823
01:55:00,125 --> 01:55:01,792
Steady, lads!

1824
01:55:05,583 --> 01:55:06,542
(flare explodes)

1825
01:55:06,625 --> 01:55:08,000
(passengers gasping)

1826
01:55:22,375 --> 01:55:25,625
(crewman shouting orders indistinctly)

1827
01:55:48,875 --> 01:55:53,000
You know, I do believe this ship may sink.

1828
01:55:54,458 --> 01:55:58,667
I've been asked to give you\nthis small token of our appreciation.

1829
01:56:01,625 --> 01:56:04,458
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1830
01:56:11,208 --> 01:56:14,083
Come on, sister, you heard the man,\ninto the boat.

1831
01:56:14,166 --> 01:56:16,291
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

1832
01:56:16,375 --> 01:56:17,959
LIGHTOLLER: Only women at this time, sir.

1833
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Will the lifeboats be seated\naccording to class?

1834
01:56:25,375 --> 01:56:28,333
I hope they're not too crowded.

1835
01:56:28,417 --> 01:56:29,834
Oh, Mother...

1836
01:56:29,917 --> 01:56:30,875
Shut up!

1837
01:56:30,959 --> 01:56:33,125
Don't you understand?

1838
01:56:33,208 --> 01:56:35,250
The water is freezing\nand there aren't enough boats.

1839
01:56:35,333 --> 01:56:37,041
Not enough by half.

1840
01:56:37,959 --> 01:56:40,333
Half the people on this ship\nare going to die.

1841
01:56:40,417 --> 01:56:41,834
Not the better half.

1842
01:56:44,208 --> 01:56:45,291
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.

1843
01:56:45,375 --> 01:56:47,291
First-class seats are right up here.

1844
01:56:48,291 --> 01:56:50,750
You know, it's a pity\nI didn't keep that drawing.

1845
01:56:50,834 --> 01:56:52,458
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.

1846
01:56:56,125 --> 01:56:58,583
You unimaginable bastard.

1847
01:56:59,709 --> 01:57:03,208
MOLLY: Come on, Rose, darling.\nThere's plenty of room for you.

1848
01:57:03,291 --> 01:57:04,208
Come on, Rose.

1849
01:57:05,333 --> 01:57:06,625
You're next, darling.

1850
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:08,500
Come in to the boat, Rose.

1851
01:57:10,083 --> 01:57:10,959
CAL: Come.

1852
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:15,750
Rose. Get into the boat.

1853
01:57:15,834 --> 01:57:17,250
Rose.

1854
01:57:18,792 --> 01:57:20,041
Goodbye, Mother.

1855
01:57:22,083 --> 01:57:23,709
Rose!

1856
01:57:23,792 --> 01:57:26,417
-RUTH: Rose, come back here!\n-Where are you going?

1857
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:27,917
To him?

1858
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,083
To be a whore to a gutter rat?

1859
01:57:31,250 --> 01:57:33,375
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.

1860
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:37,208
(struggling)

1861
01:57:37,291 --> 01:57:40,375
No! I said no!

1862
01:57:40,458 --> 01:57:41,792
(hawking)

1863
01:57:41,875 --> 01:57:43,875
RUTH (shouting): Rose!\nPlease stop!

1864
01:57:44,834 --> 01:57:46,125
LIGHTOLLER: And lower away!

1865
01:57:46,709 --> 01:57:48,166
-Rose!\n-And together!

1866
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:49,125
No, wait!

1867
01:57:49,208 --> 01:57:50,458
Lower away!

1868
01:57:50,542 --> 01:57:52,917
-Rose!\n-Lower together!

1869
01:57:58,375 --> 01:57:59,291
Help!

1870
01:58:00,333 --> 01:58:02,458
Can anybody hear me?

1871
01:58:02,542 --> 01:58:03,625
(banging pipe)

1872
01:58:03,709 --> 01:58:05,500
Hello, help me!

1873
01:58:05,583 --> 01:58:07,375
Help me!

1874
01:58:07,458 --> 01:58:08,875
(banging on pipe)

1875
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:12,291
Can anybody hear me?

1876
01:58:12,375 --> 01:58:15,333
Somebody help me, please!

1877
01:58:15,417 --> 01:58:16,417
ROSE: Mr. Andrews?

1878
01:58:20,291 --> 01:58:22,834
-Steward, check the starboard corridor.\n-Yes, Mr. Andrews.

1879
01:58:22,917 --> 01:58:25,750
Madam, please, put on a lifebelt.\nGet to the boat deck immediately.

1880
01:58:25,834 --> 01:58:27,959
Lucy, for God's sake,\nput on your lifebelt.

1881
01:58:28,041 --> 01:58:30,333
-Set a good example.\n-Yes, sir.

1882
01:58:30,417 --> 01:58:31,291
Anyone in here?

1883
01:58:31,375 --> 01:58:34,208
Mr. Andrews? Mr. Andrews, thank God.

1884
01:58:34,291 --> 01:58:36,667
Where would the master-at-arms\ntake someone under arrest?

1885
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:39,041
What? You have to get\nto a boat right away.

1886
01:58:39,125 --> 01:58:42,125
No! I'm doing this with or without\nyour help, sir,

1887
01:58:42,208 --> 01:58:43,625
but without will take longer.

1888
01:58:45,625 --> 01:58:47,709
Take the elevator to the very bottom.

1889
01:58:47,792 --> 01:58:50,000
Go to the left,\ndown the crewmen's passage.

1890
01:58:50,083 --> 01:58:52,417
Then go right\nand left again at the stairs.

1891
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:54,291
You'll come to a long corridor.

1892
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,458
(sighs) This could be bad.

1893
01:59:00,542 --> 01:59:01,709
(water gurgling)

1894
01:59:04,458 --> 01:59:06,125
Oh, shit.

1895
01:59:06,208 --> 01:59:07,291
Oh, shit!

1896
01:59:09,083 --> 01:59:10,917
(struggling)

1897
01:59:12,458 --> 01:59:14,041
Excuse me, thank you.

1898
01:59:15,083 --> 01:59:17,208
-CREWMAN: The lifts are closed.\n-WOMAN: I do not care...

1899
01:59:17,291 --> 01:59:20,959
The lifts are... I'm sorry, miss,\nbut the lifts are closed.

1900
01:59:22,125 --> 01:59:24,208
I'm through being polite, goddamn it!

1901
01:59:24,291 --> 01:59:25,667
Now take me down!

1902
01:59:27,542 --> 01:59:28,709
"E" deck.

1903
01:59:32,333 --> 01:59:33,542
Come on.

1904
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:35,083
Come on, come on.

1905
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:38,959
(screams in frustration)

1906
01:59:51,125 --> 01:59:52,583
(Rose screams)

1907
01:59:52,667 --> 01:59:54,083
I'm going back up!

1908
01:59:54,166 --> 01:59:55,291
No!

1909
01:59:55,375 --> 01:59:56,750
No, no!

1910
02:00:00,709 --> 02:00:01,583
Come back!

1911
02:00:01,667 --> 02:00:02,750
I'm going back up.

1912
02:00:02,834 --> 02:00:03,917
I'm going back up!

1913
02:00:12,709 --> 02:00:13,792
Crew passage...

1914
02:00:15,667 --> 02:00:17,250
Crew passage.

1915
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:30,875
(breathing heavily)

1916
02:00:37,417 --> 02:00:38,583
Jack?

1917
02:00:42,917 --> 02:00:44,125
Jack?

1918
02:00:48,083 --> 02:00:49,375
Jack?

1919
02:00:50,291 --> 02:00:51,166
Jack?

1920
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:52,250
Rose!

1921
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:54,542
Jack?

1922
02:00:54,625 --> 02:00:56,125
Rose, I'm in here!

1923
02:00:56,208 --> 02:00:58,125
-I'm in here.\n-Jack!

1924
02:00:58,208 --> 02:00:59,583
I'm in here.

1925
02:00:59,667 --> 02:01:00,583
-Jack!\n-Rose!

1926
02:01:00,667 --> 02:01:02,458
Jack! Jack!

1927
02:01:02,542 --> 02:01:03,875
I'm sorry.

1928
02:01:03,959 --> 02:01:06,417
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1929
02:01:07,375 --> 02:01:08,667
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.

1930
02:01:08,750 --> 02:01:10,709
I know, I know, I know, I know.

1931
02:01:10,792 --> 02:01:14,458
Listen, Rose, you're gonna have to find\na spare key, all right?

1932
02:01:14,542 --> 02:01:16,000
Look in that cabinet right there.

1933
02:01:17,125 --> 02:01:18,792
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1934
02:01:20,041 --> 02:01:21,166
Silver...

1935
02:01:21,792 --> 02:01:23,500
These are all brass ones!

1936
02:01:23,583 --> 02:01:25,417
Check right here, Rose.

1937
02:01:30,125 --> 02:01:30,959
Rose.

1938
02:01:32,041 --> 02:01:34,208
How did you find out I didn't do it?

1939
02:01:34,291 --> 02:01:36,208
I didn't.

1940
02:01:36,291 --> 02:01:37,959
I just realized I already knew.

1941
02:01:40,375 --> 02:01:41,583
-Keep looking.\n-Oh.

1942
02:01:50,792 --> 02:01:53,291
No key. There's no key!

1943
02:01:53,375 --> 02:01:54,375
All right, Rose, listen.

1944
02:01:54,458 --> 02:01:56,917
You're gonna have to go find some help.

1945
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,083
It'll be all right.

1946
02:02:03,458 --> 02:02:04,667
I'll be right back.

1947
02:02:08,250 --> 02:02:09,250
(grunting)

1948
02:02:12,417 --> 02:02:13,917
I'll just wait here.

1949
02:02:27,208 --> 02:02:29,333
Hello, is there anyone here?

1950
02:02:29,417 --> 02:02:30,583
Hello?

1951
02:02:31,583 --> 02:02:34,333
Is there anybody down here?

1952
02:02:34,417 --> 02:02:36,375
We need help! Hello!

1953
02:02:37,792 --> 02:02:39,083
Damn it.

1954
02:02:45,250 --> 02:02:46,667
Can anybody hear me?

1955
02:02:46,750 --> 02:02:48,166
Please, hello!

1956
02:02:48,250 --> 02:02:49,333
Hello!

1957
02:02:51,417 --> 02:02:52,750
Oh, thank God.

1958
02:02:52,834 --> 02:02:53,917
Wait, please, I need your help.

1959
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
There's a man back here and...

1960
02:02:56,083 --> 02:02:56,917
Wait!

1961
02:03:01,333 --> 02:03:02,834
Hello?

1962
02:03:14,083 --> 02:03:16,625
(loud rumbling)

1963
02:03:16,709 --> 02:03:20,583
(breathing rapidly)

1964
02:03:27,125 --> 02:03:28,583
(footsteps approaching)

1965
02:03:28,667 --> 02:03:29,667
Hello?

1966
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:31,750
Ah, miss, you shouldn't be here, now.

1967
02:03:31,834 --> 02:03:33,792
Wait. Please, I need your help.

1968
02:03:33,875 --> 02:03:34,959
This way, quickly.

1969
02:03:35,041 --> 02:03:36,625
There is a man down here,\nand he is trapped.

1970
02:03:36,709 --> 02:03:37,625
Please.

1971
02:03:37,709 --> 02:03:38,709
There's no need to panic.

1972
02:03:38,792 --> 02:03:39,709
No, I'm not panicking.

1973
02:03:39,792 --> 02:03:42,000
You're going the wrong way!

1974
02:03:42,083 --> 02:03:43,917
Let go of me, listen!

1975
02:03:49,208 --> 02:03:50,583
To hell with you.

1976
02:03:51,625 --> 02:03:52,875
Oh!

1977
02:03:52,959 --> 02:03:55,208
(ship creaking)

1978
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:17,875
(flare exploding)

1979
02:04:28,125 --> 02:04:30,208
(softly) Oh, my God.

1980
02:04:34,917 --> 02:04:37,542
(electrical crackling)

1981
02:04:48,792 --> 02:04:50,959
(gasping)

1982
02:04:59,458 --> 02:05:01,208
(breathing heavily)

1983
02:05:09,834 --> 02:05:12,083
(loud rumbling)

1984
02:05:18,417 --> 02:05:19,417
Jack!

1985
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:20,375
Rose!

1986
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:23,291
Will this work?

1987
02:05:24,166 --> 02:05:25,291
I guess we'll find out.

1988
02:05:25,375 --> 02:05:26,709
Come on.

1989
02:05:30,041 --> 02:05:31,542
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1990
02:05:32,166 --> 02:05:33,834
Try a couple practice swings over there.

1991
02:05:39,458 --> 02:05:42,500
Good, now try to hit\nthe same mark again, Rose.

1992
02:05:42,583 --> 02:05:43,583
You can do it.

1993
02:05:49,625 --> 02:05:51,542
Okay, that's enough practice.

1994
02:05:51,625 --> 02:05:53,125
Come on, Rose, you can do it.

1995
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:58,083
Listen, just hit it\nreally hard and really fast.

1996
02:05:59,458 --> 02:06:02,250
Wait. Open your hands up\na little more.

1997
02:06:02,917 --> 02:06:03,792
Like that?

1998
02:06:03,875 --> 02:06:05,083
Right.

1999
02:06:05,166 --> 02:06:07,917
Listen, Rose, I trust you.

2000
02:06:12,250 --> 02:06:13,083
Go!

2001
02:06:14,291 --> 02:06:16,208
-(clanging)\n-(gasps)

2002
02:06:17,375 --> 02:06:19,500
(screaming and laughing)

2003
02:06:19,583 --> 02:06:20,500
You did it!

2004
02:06:20,583 --> 02:06:22,875
Come on, let's go.

2005
02:06:22,959 --> 02:06:24,500
Oh, shit, this is cold.

2006
02:06:24,583 --> 02:06:25,667
Oh, shit!

2007
02:06:25,750 --> 02:06:27,500
Shit, shit.

2008
02:06:33,083 --> 02:06:33,959
This is the way out.

2009
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,250
We have to find another way.\nCome on.

2010
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,166
TILLER: Pull.

2011
02:06:39,250 --> 02:06:40,875
(orchestra playing)

2012
02:06:40,959 --> 02:06:42,041
Pull.

2013
02:06:42,125 --> 02:06:44,583
Put your backs into it, pull!

2014
02:06:44,667 --> 02:06:49,333
(distant shouting)

2015
02:06:49,417 --> 02:06:50,792
Pull!

2016
02:06:51,792 --> 02:06:53,875
Now, there's something\nyou don't see every day.

2017
02:06:53,959 --> 02:06:54,792
Pull!

2018
02:06:59,333 --> 02:07:01,208
(distant explosion)

2019
02:07:04,375 --> 02:07:06,375
(crewman shouting orders)

2020
02:07:14,667 --> 02:07:16,709
LIGHTOLLER: There's no room\nfor luggage in this boat.

2021
02:07:16,792 --> 02:07:17,625
What's this luggage doing here?

2022
02:07:17,709 --> 02:07:19,417
Get rid of it. Get rid of it!\nWe need the room.

2023
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:20,417
Get rid of that!

2024
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:23,125
(crewman giving orders)

2025
02:07:23,208 --> 02:07:25,542
(crying)

2026
02:07:25,625 --> 02:07:26,709
Keep calm.

2027
02:07:27,625 --> 02:07:28,750
No!

2028
02:07:34,041 --> 02:07:35,417
Lovejoy.

2029
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:37,667
She's not on the starboard side either.

2030
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:39,333
We're running out of time,

2031
02:07:39,417 --> 02:07:42,000
and this strutting martinet\nisn't letting any men on at all.

2032
02:07:42,083 --> 02:07:44,583
There's one on the other side\nletting men on.

2033
02:07:44,667 --> 02:07:46,792
Well, then that's our play.

2034
02:07:46,875 --> 02:07:48,458
We'll need some insurance first.

2035
02:07:48,542 --> 02:07:49,375
Come on.

2036
02:07:49,458 --> 02:07:50,458
(pounding on door)

2037
02:07:50,542 --> 02:07:52,166
This way. All the way down here.

2038
02:07:52,250 --> 02:07:53,375
(pounding on door)

2039
02:07:53,458 --> 02:07:54,917
(Jack yelling)

2040
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,500
Here. What do you think\nyou're doing?

2041
02:07:59,166 --> 02:08:01,000
You'll have to pay for that, you know.

2042
02:08:01,083 --> 02:08:03,375
That's White Star Line property.

2043
02:08:03,458 --> 02:08:04,333
BOTH: Shut up!

2044
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,417
Will you hold the boat a moment?

2045
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:09,917
-I just have to run back to my room--\n-(grunts)

2046
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,542
Sit down!

2047
02:08:11,625 --> 02:08:12,750
She's the last.

2048
02:08:12,834 --> 02:08:13,709
Prepare to lower.

2049
02:08:13,792 --> 02:08:17,000
Mr. Lightoller, why are the\nboats being launched half full?

2050
02:08:17,083 --> 02:08:18,041
Not now, Mr. Andrews.

2051
02:08:18,125 --> 02:08:21,542
There, look, 20 or so\nin a boat built for 65,

2052
02:08:21,625 --> 02:08:23,875
and I saw one boat with only 12.\nTwelve!

2053
02:08:23,959 --> 02:08:27,083
Well, we weren't sure\nof the weight, Mr. Andrews.

2054
02:08:27,166 --> 02:08:28,291
These boats may buckle.

2055
02:08:28,375 --> 02:08:29,709
Rubbish.

2056
02:08:29,792 --> 02:08:32,792
They were tested in Belfast\nwith the weight of 70 men!

2057
02:08:32,875 --> 02:08:35,583
Now, fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller,\nfor God's sake, man!

2058
02:08:42,417 --> 02:08:45,417
Please, I need more\nwomen and children, please.

2059
02:08:50,750 --> 02:08:52,583
CREWMAN: Get back in there.\nThis is not an exit.

2060
02:08:52,667 --> 02:08:54,709
Get back in there. This is not an exit.

2061
02:08:57,542 --> 02:08:59,208
You can't keep us locked\nin here like animals.

2062
02:08:59,291 --> 02:09:00,375
The ship's bloody sinking!

2063
02:09:01,542 --> 02:09:03,667
Bring forward the women!

2064
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:04,834
Unlock the gates.

2065
02:09:06,333 --> 02:09:07,959
Women only!

2066
02:09:08,041 --> 02:09:09,583
No men!

2067
02:09:10,709 --> 02:09:12,041
No men!

2068
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:14,875
(shouting)

2069
02:09:16,458 --> 02:09:18,834
(shouting) Get back!

2070
02:09:20,834 --> 02:09:22,917
Lock the gates!

2071
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,291
Get them back from those gates!

2072
02:09:25,375 --> 02:09:27,417
Don't touch the gates!

2073
02:09:30,542 --> 02:09:34,000
For God's sake, man,\nthere are women and children down here!

2074
02:09:34,083 --> 02:09:36,667
Let us up so we can have a chance!

2075
02:09:36,750 --> 02:09:38,709
Get back!

2076
02:09:41,834 --> 02:09:43,417
-Jack!\n-Tommy!

2077
02:09:43,500 --> 02:09:45,208
-Can we get out?\n-It's hopeless that way!

2078
02:09:45,291 --> 02:09:47,083
Whatever we do, we've got to do it fast.

2079
02:09:47,625 --> 02:09:48,583
Jack!

2080
02:09:49,291 --> 02:09:50,166
Fabrizio!

2081
02:09:50,250 --> 02:09:52,166
The boats are all gone.

2082
02:09:52,250 --> 02:09:54,375
This whole place is flooding.\nWe've gotta get out.

2083
02:09:54,458 --> 02:09:55,417
There is niente this way.

2084
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:58,000
All right, let's go this way,\nall right? Come on.

2085
02:10:03,458 --> 02:10:05,000
I make my own luck.

2086
02:10:05,083 --> 02:10:07,083
So do I.

2087
02:10:14,667 --> 02:10:16,208
Come on!

2088
02:10:16,291 --> 02:10:18,208
No, come on, let's go this way.

2089
02:10:19,709 --> 02:10:20,959
(crying)

2090
02:10:21,083 --> 02:10:24,458
(speaking Arabic)

2091
02:10:27,125 --> 02:10:28,083
This way.

2092
02:10:28,166 --> 02:10:30,625
Just go back to the main stairwell

2093
02:10:30,709 --> 02:10:32,834
and everything will be sorted out there.

2094
02:10:32,917 --> 02:10:34,458
MAN: Hell, it will.

2095
02:10:34,542 --> 02:10:36,208
It will all get sorted out back there.

2096
02:10:36,291 --> 02:10:37,583
Go back to the main stairwell.

2097
02:10:38,125 --> 02:10:39,000
Open the gate.

2098
02:10:39,083 --> 02:10:40,083
Go back down the main stair.

2099
02:10:40,166 --> 02:10:41,208
Open the gate right now!

2100
02:10:41,291 --> 02:10:43,834
Go back down the main stairwell\nlike I told you.

2101
02:10:45,834 --> 02:10:47,125
Goddamn it!

2102
02:10:47,208 --> 02:10:48,959
Son of a bitch!

2103
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:50,500
MAN: Open the damn gate!

2104
02:10:50,583 --> 02:10:51,875
Open it!

2105
02:10:54,834 --> 02:10:56,208
Fabri, Tommy, give me a hand here!

2106
02:10:56,291 --> 02:10:57,417
Move aside. Move aside.

2107
02:10:57,500 --> 02:10:58,458
Come on, pull!

2108
02:10:59,166 --> 02:11:00,959
(shouting) Pull!

2109
02:11:01,709 --> 02:11:02,834
Move aside!

2110
02:11:02,917 --> 02:11:03,834
Put that down.

2111
02:11:03,917 --> 02:11:05,250
Move aside!

2112
02:11:05,333 --> 02:11:07,000
One! Two!

2113
02:11:07,083 --> 02:11:09,083
-Stop that!\n-Three!

2114
02:11:09,166 --> 02:11:11,166
(yelling)

2115
02:11:11,250 --> 02:11:12,250
Again!

2116
02:11:12,333 --> 02:11:14,208
(yelling)

2117
02:11:14,291 --> 02:11:15,542
JACK: Let's go!

2118
02:11:17,667 --> 02:11:19,792
-JACK: Let's go, Rose.\n-You can't go up there.

2119
02:11:19,875 --> 02:11:21,166
You can't do this!

2120
02:11:28,083 --> 02:11:29,417
LIGHTOLLER: Keep order here.

2121
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:32,291
Back, back, back.

2122
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:35,083
(screaming)

2123
02:11:36,875 --> 02:11:37,875
Hold on to her!

2124
02:11:39,667 --> 02:11:41,125
Pull her in!

2125
02:11:41,208 --> 02:11:43,875
Get back, I say,

2126
02:11:43,959 --> 02:11:46,542
or I'll shoot you all like dogs.

2127
02:11:46,625 --> 02:11:47,959
Keep order here!

2128
02:11:49,250 --> 02:11:51,208
Keep order, I say.

2129
02:11:52,166 --> 02:11:54,750
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

2130
02:11:58,834 --> 02:12:01,667
LOWE: Right, is everybody\nall right?

2131
02:12:01,750 --> 02:12:03,083
Nobody panic.

2132
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:10,583
CREWMAN: Stay back!

2133
02:12:11,458 --> 02:12:12,709
We're too late.

2134
02:12:12,792 --> 02:12:14,250
There are more boats down the front.

2135
02:12:14,333 --> 02:12:17,917
Stay with this one. Murdoch.\nHe seems to be quite practical.

2136
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,041
(women screaming)

2137
02:12:28,166 --> 02:12:30,625
(screaming)

2138
02:12:32,583 --> 02:12:33,583
LOWE: Sit down!

2139
02:12:35,083 --> 02:12:36,834
Stay back, you lot.

2140
02:12:36,917 --> 02:12:37,875
Stay back!

2141
02:12:37,959 --> 02:12:39,291
Stay back, the lot of you!

2142
02:12:39,375 --> 02:12:40,291
Stay back!

2143
02:12:40,375 --> 02:12:41,291
(gunshots)

2144
02:12:42,583 --> 02:12:43,917
It's starting to fall apart.

2145
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,500
We don't have much time.

2146
02:12:47,208 --> 02:12:48,291
Mr. Murdoch?

2147
02:12:48,375 --> 02:12:49,458
Mr. Hockley.

2148
02:12:49,542 --> 02:12:51,417
You two, with me, now.

2149
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:53,208
I'm a businessman, as you know,

2150
02:12:53,291 --> 02:12:55,250
and I have a business proposition for you.

2151
02:12:55,667 --> 02:12:58,417
CREWMAN (shouting):\nEasy now. All together!

2152
02:12:59,750 --> 02:13:02,458
Lower away, lower away.

2153
02:13:02,542 --> 02:13:03,875
JACK: Come on, Rose.

2154
02:13:07,417 --> 02:13:08,875
The boats are gone!

2155
02:13:14,166 --> 02:13:15,792
Colonel, are there any boats on that side?

2156
02:13:15,875 --> 02:13:18,208
No, miss, but there are a couple of boats\nall the way forward.

2157
02:13:18,291 --> 02:13:19,750
This way, I'll lead you.

2158
02:13:23,166 --> 02:13:25,208
(playing final chord)

2159
02:13:25,959 --> 02:13:27,083
What's the use?

2160
02:13:27,166 --> 02:13:29,709
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

2161
02:13:29,792 --> 02:13:31,500
Well, they don't listen to us\nat dinner either.

2162
02:13:31,583 --> 02:13:32,583
Come on, let's play.

2163
02:13:32,667 --> 02:13:33,792
Keep us warm.

2164
02:13:34,792 --> 02:13:35,709
"Orpheus."

2165
02:13:36,792 --> 02:13:41,041
(playing fast music from\n"Orpheus in the Underworld")

2166
02:13:41,125 --> 02:13:42,208
Music to drown by.

2167
02:13:42,291 --> 02:13:44,291
Now I know I'm in first class.

2168
02:13:49,458 --> 02:13:50,667
Where is everyone?

2169
02:13:50,750 --> 02:13:52,834
They're all still aft, sir.

2170
02:13:54,959 --> 02:13:57,375
Do we have an understanding\nthen, Mr. Murdoch?

2171
02:14:08,542 --> 02:14:10,625
LIGHTOLLER (shouting):\nWill the men please go back?

2172
02:14:10,709 --> 02:14:12,750
(people shouting)

2173
02:14:12,834 --> 02:14:14,792
(gunshots)

2174
02:14:14,875 --> 02:14:17,208
Women and children only!

2175
02:14:17,291 --> 02:14:18,667
Get back!

2176
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:19,750
Step back, sir.

2177
02:14:19,834 --> 02:14:20,875
Come through, madam.

2178
02:14:20,959 --> 02:14:21,834
This way.

2179
02:14:21,917 --> 02:14:22,834
Step back, sir.

2180
02:14:22,917 --> 02:14:24,375
Let the women through!

2181
02:14:24,458 --> 02:14:25,834
You better check the other side.

2182
02:14:25,917 --> 02:14:27,000
Go!

2183
02:14:27,083 --> 02:14:29,083
LIGHTOLLER: Stand back, sir!

2184
02:14:29,166 --> 02:14:32,125
MURDOCH: Any more women\nand children?

2185
02:14:32,208 --> 02:14:34,083
Any children?

2186
02:14:34,166 --> 02:14:36,375
I found her on the other side.

2187
02:14:36,458 --> 02:14:38,458
Waiting for a boat...

2188
02:14:38,542 --> 02:14:39,625
with him.

2189
02:14:41,208 --> 02:14:42,583
MURDOCH: Any more women\nand children?

2190
02:14:42,667 --> 02:14:43,709
They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

2191
02:14:43,792 --> 02:14:45,542
Anyone else, then?

2192
02:14:46,667 --> 02:14:47,875
-ISMAY: Hop on, sir.\n-Anyone else?

2193
02:14:47,959 --> 02:14:49,083
Do hurry. Hurry along.

2194
02:14:53,208 --> 02:14:54,583
Stand by the falls.

2195
02:14:54,667 --> 02:14:56,917
(softly) Ugh, goddamn it all to hell.

2196
02:14:59,583 --> 02:15:00,625
Shit.

2197
02:15:00,709 --> 02:15:01,625
Fire!

2198
02:15:02,625 --> 02:15:03,458
Sir!

2199
02:15:03,542 --> 02:15:05,125
Sir, you can't go through here.

2200
02:15:05,208 --> 02:15:06,709
Sir, you can't go through.

2201
02:15:09,166 --> 02:15:10,417
Yes, yes, splendid.

2202
02:15:13,041 --> 02:15:14,166
Right.

2203
02:15:15,166 --> 02:15:17,166
MURDOCH: Prepare to lower!

2204
02:15:19,291 --> 02:15:20,583
Ready on the left.

2205
02:15:26,750 --> 02:15:28,458
Take them down.

2206
02:15:33,333 --> 02:15:35,083
Keep it steady.

2207
02:15:36,792 --> 02:15:39,750
Both sides together, steady.

2208
02:15:39,834 --> 02:15:41,291
Keep it steady.

2209
02:15:42,208 --> 02:15:43,875
Give her to me.

2210
02:15:43,959 --> 02:15:45,041
GIRL: Daddy...

2211
02:15:45,125 --> 02:15:47,250
MAN: It'll be fine, darling.\nDon't you worry.

2212
02:15:49,166 --> 02:15:50,917
It's goodbye for a little while.

2213
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,417
Only for a little while.

2214
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:54,583
There'll be another boat for the daddies.

2215
02:15:54,667 --> 02:15:56,375
This boat's for the mummies\nand the children.

2216
02:15:56,458 --> 02:15:58,875
You hold Mummy's hand\nand be a good little girl.

2217
02:16:00,250 --> 02:16:01,500
I'm not going without you.

2218
02:16:01,583 --> 02:16:03,166
No, you have to go... now!

2219
02:16:03,250 --> 02:16:04,291
No, Jack.

2220
02:16:04,375 --> 02:16:05,917
Get in the boat, Rose.

2221
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,375
No, Jack.

2222
02:16:07,458 --> 02:16:09,250
Yes, get on the boat.

2223
02:16:09,333 --> 02:16:11,417
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

2224
02:16:13,959 --> 02:16:15,667
Oh, my God, look at you.

2225
02:16:15,750 --> 02:16:17,333
You look a fright.

2226
02:16:17,417 --> 02:16:18,625
Here.

2227
02:16:20,333 --> 02:16:21,709
Put this on.

2228
02:16:21,792 --> 02:16:22,667
Come.

2229
02:16:28,041 --> 02:16:29,625
Go on, I'll get the next one.

2230
02:16:29,709 --> 02:16:31,834
No, not without you.

2231
02:16:31,917 --> 02:16:32,959
JACK: I'll be all right.

2232
02:16:33,041 --> 02:16:33,959
Listen, I'll be fine.

2233
02:16:34,041 --> 02:16:35,166
I'm a survivor, all right?

2234
02:16:35,250 --> 02:16:36,166
Don't worry about me.

2235
02:16:36,250 --> 02:16:37,458
Now go on, get on.

2236
02:16:37,542 --> 02:16:40,250
I have an arrangement with an officer\non the other side of the ship.

2237
02:16:40,333 --> 02:16:41,709
Jack and I can get off safely.

2238
02:16:41,792 --> 02:16:43,208
Both of us.

2239
02:16:44,458 --> 02:16:47,041
See? Got my own boat to catch.

2240
02:16:47,125 --> 02:16:48,375
CAL: Now, hurry.

2241
02:16:48,458 --> 02:16:49,750
They're almost full.

2242
02:16:51,125 --> 02:16:52,625
Step aboard, miss.

2243
02:16:52,709 --> 02:16:53,875
CAL: Come on, hurry.

2244
02:16:54,583 --> 02:16:55,417
Step aboard, please.

2245
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:56,792
MAN: Be Daddy's good girl.

2246
02:16:56,875 --> 02:16:57,959
Step lightly.

2247
02:16:58,041 --> 02:17:00,125
LIGHTOLLER: Keep back, keep back, I say.

2248
02:17:02,333 --> 02:17:03,583
Clear the row, please.

2249
02:17:05,083 --> 02:17:06,375
Lower away!

2250
02:17:07,458 --> 02:17:08,792
(gasping)

2251
02:17:10,041 --> 02:17:11,417
LIGHTOLLER: Steady!

2252
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:13,834
Keep going, keep going.

2253
02:17:13,917 --> 02:17:16,667
And lower away evenly, lads.

2254
02:17:17,583 --> 02:17:19,834
Easy. Lower away.

2255
02:17:19,917 --> 02:17:21,583
You're a good liar.

2256
02:17:21,667 --> 02:17:23,875
Almost as good as you.

2257
02:17:23,959 --> 02:17:27,333
LIGHTOLLER: Easy now, and lower away.

2258
02:17:28,834 --> 02:17:30,375
There's no, uh,

2259
02:17:30,458 --> 02:17:32,417
there's no arrangement, is there?

2260
02:17:33,875 --> 02:17:35,417
No, there is.

2261
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:37,458
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

2262
02:17:39,625 --> 02:17:41,333
I always win, Jack,

2263
02:17:42,667 --> 02:17:43,667
one way or another.

2264
02:17:47,959 --> 02:17:52,000
LIGHTOLLER: Easy. Even, lads.

2265
02:17:52,083 --> 02:17:54,291
Keep going, keep going.

2266
02:17:59,625 --> 02:18:04,750
(refrain from\n"My Heart Will Go On" playing)

2267
02:18:15,250 --> 02:18:17,083
(inaudible)

2268
02:18:42,250 --> 02:18:43,250
Rose!

2269
02:18:43,333 --> 02:18:45,917
(passengers shouting)

2270
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:46,875
CAL: Stop her!

2271
02:18:46,959 --> 02:18:48,291
Rose, what are you doing?

2272
02:18:48,375 --> 02:18:49,333
CAL: Stop her!

2273
02:18:50,709 --> 02:18:51,542
No!

2274
02:19:09,917 --> 02:19:11,000
Rose.

2275
02:19:14,250 --> 02:19:15,709
You're so stupid.

2276
02:19:15,792 --> 02:19:17,709
Why'd you do that, huh?

2277
02:19:17,792 --> 02:19:19,542
You're so stupid, Rose.

2278
02:19:21,208 --> 02:19:23,583
Why did you do that? Why?

2279
02:19:23,667 --> 02:19:25,709
You jump, I jump, right?

2280
02:19:27,625 --> 02:19:28,500
Right.

2281
02:19:30,709 --> 02:19:33,041
Oh, God, I couldn't go.

2282
02:19:33,125 --> 02:19:35,458
I couldn't go, Jack.

2283
02:19:35,542 --> 02:19:38,500
It's all right. We'll think of something.

2284
02:19:38,583 --> 02:19:41,208
-ROSE: At least I'm with you.\n-We'll think of something.

2285
02:19:54,166 --> 02:19:55,083
Come on!

2286
02:19:55,625 --> 02:19:56,583
(gunshot)

2287
02:19:59,250 --> 02:20:00,333
Come on, move!

2288
02:20:07,250 --> 02:20:08,166
Come on.

2289
02:20:08,250 --> 02:20:09,625
-(gunshot)\n-(Rose screams)

2290
02:20:16,208 --> 02:20:17,041
Move!

2291
02:20:18,291 --> 02:20:19,959
-(gunshot)\n-(Rose screams)

2292
02:20:23,625 --> 02:20:24,709
Come on, come on, Rose.

2293
02:20:25,625 --> 02:20:26,667
Come on.

2294
02:20:26,750 --> 02:20:27,583
(gunshot)

2295
02:20:27,667 --> 02:20:28,667
Move, come on!

2296
02:20:29,667 --> 02:20:31,375
(gunshot)

2297
02:20:31,458 --> 02:20:32,583
Move, Rose!

2298
02:20:35,125 --> 02:20:35,959
(gunshot)

2299
02:20:36,041 --> 02:20:37,000
JACK: Go!

2300
02:20:40,125 --> 02:20:41,542
(shouts in frustration)

2301
02:20:42,875 --> 02:20:47,041
(metal groaning)

2302
02:20:47,125 --> 02:20:49,834
I hope you enjoy your time together.

2303
02:21:01,959 --> 02:21:04,166
(laughing)

2304
02:21:04,250 --> 02:21:06,500
What could possibly be funny?

2305
02:21:06,583 --> 02:21:09,000
I put the diamond in the coat.

2306
02:21:12,291 --> 02:21:14,417
And I put the coat on her!

2307
02:21:15,875 --> 02:21:17,208
Come on.

2308
02:21:26,166 --> 02:21:28,166
(dishes clinking)

2309
02:21:31,625 --> 02:21:35,709
(child yelling)

2310
02:21:37,333 --> 02:21:40,166
(screaming)

2311
02:21:41,208 --> 02:21:42,375
We can't leave him.

2312
02:21:46,333 --> 02:21:47,458
All right, come on.

2313
02:21:50,917 --> 02:21:52,083
(wailing)

2314
02:21:55,417 --> 02:21:57,041
(creaking)

2315
02:21:58,166 --> 02:22:00,458
(child screaming)

2316
02:22:04,959 --> 02:22:06,500
Go back!

2317
02:22:09,333 --> 02:22:13,625
(yelling in Czech)

2318
02:22:16,417 --> 02:22:18,417
It's the wrong way! Come back.

2319
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,750
(Rose and Jack yelling)

2320
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:27,083
Go!

2321
02:22:29,417 --> 02:22:30,542
JACK (shouting): Go!

2322
02:22:44,625 --> 02:22:46,667
-Jack!\n-Rose!

2323
02:22:49,458 --> 02:22:50,291
(Rose grunts)

2324
02:22:52,709 --> 02:22:54,792
(groaning)

2325
02:22:58,959 --> 02:23:00,458
This way.

2326
02:23:09,583 --> 02:23:10,417
Come on.

2327
02:23:11,959 --> 02:23:12,792
Give me your hand.

2328
02:23:16,667 --> 02:23:17,750
(straining)

2329
02:23:22,417 --> 02:23:23,417
Oh, God!

2330
02:23:27,583 --> 02:23:28,834
Help!

2331
02:23:34,542 --> 02:23:35,709
ROSE: Help!

2332
02:23:38,125 --> 02:23:40,333
Wait, sir! Sir, open the gate, please.

2333
02:23:40,417 --> 02:23:41,834

Oh, Rose.

2416
02:28:22,166 --> 02:28:23,625
Won't you even make a try for it?

2417
02:28:25,750 --> 02:28:29,834
I'm sorry that I didn't build you\na stronger ship, young Rose.

2418
02:28:32,125 --> 02:28:33,083
It's going fast.

2419
02:28:33,166 --> 02:28:34,208
We have to move.

2420
02:28:34,291 --> 02:28:35,458
Wait.

2421
02:28:38,834 --> 02:28:40,166
Good luck to you, Rose.

Mr. Guggenheim.

These are for you, Mr. Guggenheim.

2425
02:28:58,834 --> 02:29:00,041
No, thank you.

2426
02:29:00,125 --> 02:29:03,417
We are dressed in our best\nand are prepared to go down as gentlemen.

2427
02:29:05,125 --> 02:29:06,792
But we would like a brandy.

2428
02:29:07,709 --> 02:29:11,083
(men shouting)

2429
02:29:18,250 --> 02:29:19,583
Capitaine.

2430
02:29:19,667 --> 02:29:22,500
Capitaine, where should I go? Please.

2431
02:29:28,208 --> 02:29:29,125
CREWMAN: Captain!

2432
02:29:29,208 --> 02:29:31,458
Captain, sir.

2433
02:29:53,250 --> 02:29:56,375
(orchestra playing)

2434
02:30:02,333 --> 02:30:03,875
Right, that's it, then.

2435
02:30:05,083 --> 02:30:06,583
Good-bye, Wally, good luck.

2436
02:30:07,625 --> 02:30:09,125

(begins playing "Nearer, My God to Thee")

2438
02:30:46,375 --> 02:30:49,291
(orchestra continues playing)

2439
02:31:23,917 --> 02:31:29,000
And so they lived\nhappily together for 300 years

2440
02:31:29,083 --> 02:31:32,041
in the land of T铆r na n脫g,

2441
02:31:32,125 --> 02:31:35,250
land of eternal youth and beauty.

2442
02:31:45,792 --> 02:31:50,083
(continues playing\n"Nearer, My God to Thee")

2443
02:31:52,583 --> 02:31:54,583

2444
02:32:00,875 --> 02:32:05,250
(crewmen and passengers shouting)

2445
02:32:10,625 --> 02:32:11,917
There's no time!

2446
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:13,250
Cut those falls.

2447
02:32:13,333 --> 02:32:15,792
Cut 'em, cut 'em if you have to.

2448
02:32:16,458 --> 02:32:17,375
I need a knife.

2449
02:32:17,458 --> 02:32:18,959

2450
02:32:22,667 --> 02:32:23,959
CREWMAN: Cut her loose.

(playing last notes of song)

2454
02:33:24,625 --> 02:33:29,083
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege\nplaying with you tonight.

2455
02:33:35,250 --> 02:33:36,083
(inhales deeply)

2456
02:33:48,375 --> 02:33:50,917
(people screaming)

2457
02:33:52,959 --> 02:33:54,750
(screaming)

2458
02:34:29,041 --> 02:34:31,500
We have to stay on the ship\nas long as possible!

2459
02:34:31,583 --> 02:34:32,583
Come on!

2460
02:34:44,125 --> 02:34:45,417
JACK: This way.

2461
02:34:45,500 --> 02:34:46,875
Over the rail!

2462
02:34:49,083 --> 02:34:51,417
Come on, Rose, jump!

2463
02:34:54,125 --> 02:34:55,125

(gasping)

2466
02:35:28,291 --> 02:35:30,333
JACK: I got you.\nJump!

2467
02:35:30,417 --> 02:35:31,542
(groaning)

2468
02:35:32,208 --> 02:35:33,959
I've got you, miss!

2469
02:35:34,917 --> 02:35:36,041
-Jack!\n-Come on!

2470
02:35:37,959 --> 02:35:38,917
Get back!

2471
02:35:43,667 --> 02:35:45,542
(cables snapping)

2472
02:35:49,166 --> 02:35:50,750
(metal groaning)

2473
02:36:09,333 --> 02:36:11,041
No! You'll swamp us.

2474
02:36:15,083 --> 02:36:17,625
(hysterical shrieking)

2475
02:36:23,792 --> 02:36:27,083
Yea, though I walk through the\nvalley of the shadow of death...

2476
02:36:27,166 --> 02:36:29,917
You want to walk a little faster through\nthat valley there?

2477
02:36:39,834 --> 02:36:42,709
(screaming)

2478
02:36:52,792 --> 02:36:54,125
Row!

2479
02:36:54,208 --> 02:36:56,500
Together, men!

2480
02:37:15,458 --> 02:37:16,917
(screams)

2481
02:37:20,208 --> 02:37:21,667
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

2482
02:37:21,750 --> 02:37:25,583
pray for us sinners now and at the hour\nof our death. Amen.

2483
02:37:25,667 --> 02:37:28,458
-Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is...\n-This way.

2484
02:37:28,542 --> 02:37:29,375
Blessed art thou...

2485
02:37:38,166 --> 02:37:39,000
JACK: Come on.

2486
02:37:39,083 --> 02:37:40,417
Come on!

2487
02:37:43,583 --> 02:37:44,583
(groans)

2488
02:37:50,291 --> 02:37:52,166
I saw a new heaven and a new earth

2489
02:37:52,250 --> 02:37:55,500
when the first heaven and the first earth\nhad passed away...

2490
02:37:55,583 --> 02:37:56,583
(women screaming)

2491
02:37:56,667 --> 02:37:58,625
...and there was no more sea.

2492
02:38:01,959 --> 02:38:03,000
Ah!

2493
02:38:05,250 --> 02:38:07,250
It'll be over soon.

2494
02:38:07,333 --> 02:38:08,875
It'll all be over soon.

2495
02:38:14,125 --> 02:38:17,875
And he shall dwell with them\nand they shall be his people,

2496
02:38:17,959 --> 02:38:19,875
and God himself shall be with them...

2497
02:38:22,750 --> 02:38:24,500
Jack...

2498
02:38:24,583 --> 02:38:26,333
this is where we first met.

2499
02:38:33,583 --> 02:38:37,041
And God shall wipe away\nall the tears from their eyes

2500
02:38:37,125 --> 02:38:39,291
and there shall be no more death.

2501
02:38:40,083 --> 02:38:42,375
Neither shall there be sorrow or crying.

2502
02:38:42,458 --> 02:38:44,750
Neither shall there be any more pain

2503
02:38:45,959 --> 02:38:49,166
for the former world has passed away.

2504
02:38:56,333 --> 02:38:58,875
(shattering)

2505
02:39:03,250 --> 02:39:05,959
Bloody pull faster, and pull!

2506
02:39:08,959 --> 02:39:12,375
(screaming)

2507
02:39:13,750 --> 02:39:15,250
(screaming)

2508
02:39:28,834 --> 02:39:29,959
MAN: Hang on, Miss Trudy!

2509
02:39:30,583 --> 02:39:32,500
(screaming)

2510
02:39:33,250 --> 02:39:38,041
(crashing and shattering)

2511
02:39:45,542 --> 02:39:46,375
(screaming)

2512
02:39:54,583 --> 02:39:56,166

2516
02:40:09,166 --> 02:40:11,375
(shrieking in distance)

2517
02:40:11,458 --> 02:40:15,083
(woman sobbing)

2518
02:40:21,208 --> 02:40:24,166
(people screaming in distance)

2519
02:40:25,500 --> 02:40:26,959
God almighty!

2520
02:40:34,333 --> 02:40:36,792
CREWMAN: Get those breakers in!\nKeep them in!

2521
02:40:38,458 --> 02:40:41,792
(electricity crackling)

2522
02:40:41,875 --> 02:40:43,333
(screams)

2523
02:40:44,333 --> 02:40:45,750
(panicked screaming)

2524
02:40:45,834 --> 02:40:47,208
(ship groaning)

2525
02:40:50,792 --> 02:40:53,750
(planks splitting)

2526
02:41:12,583 --> 02:41:14,250
(everyone screaming)

2527
02:41:56,041 --> 02:41:57,375
We have to move!

2528
02:42:03,417 --> 02:42:04,917
Give me your hand, I'll pull you over.

2529
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:06,750
-I can't!\n-Come on, give me your hand!

2530
02:42:09,583 --> 02:42:10,583
I've got you.

2531
02:42:10,667 --> 02:42:11,875
I won't let go.

2532
02:42:11,959 --> 02:42:12,959
Come on, I've got you.

2533
02:42:24,625 --> 02:42:25,959
What's happening, Jack?

2534
02:42:26,041 --> 02:42:28,000
I don't know, I don't know!

2535
02:42:36,959 --> 02:42:38,250
-JACK: Hold on!\n-Jack!

2536
02:42:38,333 --> 02:42:39,458
Rose.

2537
02:42:40,208 --> 02:42:43,667
MAN: Help me, please,\nsomeone help me, please!

2538
02:42:43,750 --> 02:42:47,583
(terrified screaming, thudding)

2539
02:42:49,125 --> 02:42:50,709
(screaming)

2540
02:42:59,083 --> 02:43:00,917
(panting)

2541
02:43:02,667 --> 02:43:03,875
(screams)

2542
02:43:06,667 --> 02:43:09,583
WOMAN: Please help! Help!\nHelp! Help!

2543
02:43:10,875 --> 02:43:13,333
(woman screaming)

2544
02:43:20,250 --> 02:43:21,291
This is it!

2545
02:43:34,125 --> 02:43:36,208
ROSE: Oh, God, Jack.\nOh, God!

2546
02:43:37,250 --> 02:43:38,625
-Oh, God!\n-Hold on!

2547
02:43:38,709 --> 02:43:41,500
Oh, God, oh, God, oh!

2548
02:43:53,667 --> 02:43:56,208
The ship is gonna suck us down.

2549
02:43:56,291 --> 02:43:58,083
Take a deep breath when I say.

2550
02:44:03,750 --> 02:44:05,917
Kick for the surface and keep kicking.

2551
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:07,792
Do not let go of my hand.

2552
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:16,458
We're gonna make it, Rose.

2553
02:44:16,542 --> 02:44:18,000
Trust me.

2554
02:44:18,083 --> 02:44:19,083
I trust you.

2555
02:44:23,083 --> 02:44:25,834
Ready? Ready?

2556
02:44:26,500 --> 02:44:27,458
Now!

2557
02:44:27,542 --> 02:44:28,375
(inhales deeply)

2558
02:45:00,625 --> 02:45:02,709
(screaming)

2559
02:45:03,959 --> 02:45:05,458
Jack! Jack!

2560
02:45:06,583 --> 02:45:08,083
Jack!

2561
02:45:10,041 --> 02:45:11,208
Jack!

2562
02:45:12,166 --> 02:45:15,834
(screaming)

2563
02:45:15,917 --> 02:45:17,458
Jack.

2564
02:45:17,542 --> 02:45:18,542
Jack!

2565
02:45:35,917 --> 02:45:37,083
(gasping)

2566
02:45:37,166 --> 02:45:39,125
Jack! Jack!

2567
02:45:43,792 --> 02:45:44,917
No!

2568
02:45:46,792 --> 02:45:47,625
Jack!

2569
02:45:48,291 --> 02:45:49,875
Rose!

2570
02:45:49,959 --> 02:45:51,125
Get off her!

2571
02:45:51,208 --> 02:45:52,125
Get off her!

2572
02:45:55,750 --> 02:45:57,000
-Rose!\n-Jack!

2573
02:45:57,083 --> 02:45:59,083
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!

2574
02:46:03,166 --> 02:46:04,542
Keep swimming!

2575
02:46:08,750 --> 02:46:09,792
It's so cold!

2576
02:46:09,875 --> 02:46:11,125
Swim, Rose!

2577
02:46:16,667 --> 02:46:18,041
Come on. Here.

2578
02:46:19,417 --> 02:46:21,375
Keep swimming. Come on.

2579
02:46:24,250 --> 02:46:25,667
Here, get on it.

2580
02:46:27,250 --> 02:46:28,375
Get on top.

2581
02:46:29,333 --> 02:46:31,208
(groaning)

2582
02:46:35,875 --> 02:46:36,750
Come on, Rose.

2583
02:46:36,834 --> 02:46:37,959
(gasping)

2584
02:46:44,166 --> 02:46:45,875
(Rose screams)

2585
02:46:47,291 --> 02:46:49,041
Stay on it, stay on, Rose.

2586
02:46:49,542 --> 02:46:50,375
Jack.

2587
02:47:10,500 --> 02:47:11,959
You'll be all right now.

2588
02:47:14,750 --> 02:47:16,208
You'll be all right now.

2589
02:47:17,125 --> 02:47:20,709
(whistle blowing)

2590
02:47:23,792 --> 02:47:27,000
Return the boats!

2591
02:47:27,083 --> 02:47:28,000
(both shivering)

2592
02:47:28,083 --> 02:47:29,458
(whistle blows)

2593
02:47:30,333 --> 02:47:32,458
The boats are coming back for us, Rose.

2594
02:47:33,458 --> 02:47:34,750
Hold on just a little bit longer.

2595
02:47:34,834 --> 02:47:36,500
CREWMAN: Return the boats!

2596
02:47:36,583 --> 02:47:38,667
They had to row away for the suction,

2597
02:47:38,750 --> 02:47:41,166
but now they'll be coming back.

2598
02:47:41,250 --> 02:47:43,000
WOMAN (crying): Come back!

2599
02:47:43,875 --> 02:47:45,125
For God's sake!

2600
02:47:45,208 --> 02:47:46,166
Please!

2601
02:47:46,250 --> 02:47:47,208
Help us!

2602
02:47:47,291 --> 02:47:48,542
Help us!

2603
02:47:49,875 --> 02:47:50,917
WOMAN (shouting): Come back!

2604
02:47:51,917 --> 02:47:53,458
For God's sake!

2605
02:47:53,542 --> 02:47:55,083
You don't understand.

2606
02:47:56,125 --> 02:47:58,458
If we go back, they'll swamp the boat.

2607
02:47:58,542 --> 02:48:00,083
They'll pull us right down,\nI'm telling you.

2608
02:48:00,166 --> 02:48:03,250
Knock it off. You're scaring me.

2609
02:48:03,333 --> 02:48:05,875
Come on, girls, grab an oar, let's go!

2610
02:48:05,959 --> 02:48:07,458
CREWMAN: Are you out of your mind?

2611
02:48:07,542 --> 02:48:09,375
We're in the middle of the North Atlantic!

2612
02:48:09,458 --> 02:48:13,083
Now, do you people want to live\nor do you want to die?

2613
02:48:19,792 --> 02:48:22,125
I don't understand a one of you.

2614
02:48:23,750 --> 02:48:25,375
What's the matter with you?

2615
02:48:25,458 --> 02:48:26,750
It's your men out there!

2616
02:48:26,834 --> 02:48:27,959
(crying)

2617
02:48:29,834 --> 02:48:31,750
There's plenty of room for more.

2618
02:48:31,834 --> 02:48:33,500
And there'll be one less on this boat

2619
02:48:33,583 --> 02:48:37,333
if you don't shut that hole in your face!

2620
02:48:37,417 --> 02:48:39,166
WOMAN (in distance): Come back!

2621
02:48:39,250 --> 02:48:42,959
(whistle blowing,\npeople shouting for help)

2622
02:48:51,250 --> 02:48:52,417
MAN: Here, take this one.

2623
02:48:52,500 --> 02:48:54,959
LOWE: Now bring in your oars\nover there

2624
02:48:55,041 --> 02:48:56,917
and tie these two boats together as well.

2625
02:49:01,333 --> 02:49:04,417
Now make sure\nthat's tied up nice and tight.

2626
02:49:07,417 --> 02:49:10,250
Right, listen to me, men,\nwe have to go back.

2627
02:49:10,333 --> 02:49:13,041
I want to transfer all the women\nfrom this boat into that boat,

2628
02:49:13,125 --> 02:49:15,250
right now, as quick as you can, please.

2629
02:49:15,333 --> 02:49:16,667
Let's get some space over there.

2630
02:49:16,750 --> 02:49:17,875
Move forward and aft.

2631
02:49:21,333 --> 02:49:24,375
(scattered moaning)

2632
02:49:25,208 --> 02:49:27,583
(shivering)

2633
02:49:27,667 --> 02:49:29,458
It's getting quiet.

2634
02:49:31,667 --> 02:49:34,667
It's just gonna take 'em\na couple of minutes to get...

2635
02:49:35,709 --> 02:49:36,959
the boats organized.

2636
02:49:40,250 --> 02:49:41,917
I don't know about you,

2637
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:46,166
but I intend to write\na strongly-worded letter

2638
02:49:46,250 --> 02:49:48,500
to the White Star Line about all this.

2639
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:54,709
(scattered moaning in distance)

2640
02:49:56,041 --> 02:49:57,542
I love you, Jack.

2641
02:50:04,500 --> 02:50:05,875
Don't you do that.

2642
02:50:07,709 --> 02:50:10,208
Don't you say your goodbyes.

2643
02:50:10,291 --> 02:50:12,375
Not yet, do you understand me?

2644
02:50:13,041 --> 02:50:14,458
I'm so cold.

2645
02:50:15,458 --> 02:50:17,250
Listen, Rose,

2646
02:50:17,333 --> 02:50:19,417
you're gonna get out of here.

2647
02:50:19,500 --> 02:50:20,917
(shivering)

2648
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,417
You're gonna go on

2649
02:50:23,500 --> 02:50:26,125
and you're gonna make lots of babies,

2650
02:50:26,208 --> 02:50:28,041
and you're gonna watch them grow.

2651
02:50:30,041 --> 02:50:34,417
You're gonna die an old...\nan old lady warm in her bed.

2652
02:50:36,083 --> 02:50:37,166
Not here.

2653
02:50:37,250 --> 02:50:39,417
Not this night.

2654
02:50:39,500 --> 02:50:40,917
Not like this.

2655
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:42,333
Do you understand me?

2656
02:50:45,709 --> 02:50:47,291
I can't feel my body.

2657
02:50:49,417 --> 02:50:50,750
Winning that ticket, Rose,

2658
02:50:50,834 --> 02:50:53,291
was the best thing\nthat ever happened to me.

2659
02:50:55,083 --> 02:50:56,458
It brought me to you...

2660
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,125
and I'm thankful for that, Rose.

2661
02:51:01,208 --> 02:51:02,750
I'm thankful.

2662
02:51:03,458 --> 02:51:04,458
(crying)

2663
02:51:04,542 --> 02:51:07,250
(shivers) You must... You must...

2664
02:51:08,917 --> 02:51:10,667
You must do me this honor.

2665
02:51:13,250 --> 02:51:16,917
You must promise me that you'll survive...

2666
02:51:18,375 --> 02:51:21,834
that you won't give up...

2667
02:51:21,917 --> 02:51:24,375
no matter what happens...

2668
02:51:26,542 --> 02:51:29,083
no matter how hopeless...

2669
02:51:32,542 --> 02:51:34,417
Promise me now, Rose...

2670
02:51:36,458 --> 02:51:38,709
and never let go of that promise.

2671
02:51:40,625 --> 02:51:41,667
I promise.

2672
02:51:43,917 --> 02:51:45,458
Never let go.

2673
02:51:48,583 --> 02:51:50,333
I will never let go, Jack.

2674
02:51:50,959 --> 02:51:53,250
(shivering)

2675
02:51:53,333 --> 02:51:54,959
I'll never let go.

2676
02:51:57,959 --> 02:51:59,166
(kisses)

2677
02:51:59,250 --> 02:52:02,208
(both shivering)

2678
02:52:19,250 --> 02:52:21,125
CREWMAN: Right ahead, sir.

2679
02:52:24,041 --> 02:52:25,750
LOWE: Oars!

2680
02:52:25,834 --> 02:52:27,667
Do you see any moving?

2681
02:52:28,125 --> 02:52:30,542
No, sir. None moving, sir.

2682
02:52:30,625 --> 02:52:32,542
LOWE: Check them.

2683
02:52:32,625 --> 02:52:34,166
Bring that oar up here.

2684
02:52:40,875 --> 02:52:42,250
Check them, make sure.

2685
02:52:43,375 --> 02:52:45,333
These are dead, sir.

2686
02:52:45,417 --> 02:52:46,959
Now give way.

2687
02:52:47,041 --> 02:52:48,959
Head easy.

2688
02:52:54,709 --> 02:52:56,625
Careful with your oars.

2689
02:52:56,709 --> 02:52:58,333
Don't hit them.

2690
02:53:00,458 --> 02:53:02,792
(shouts) Is there anyone alive out there?

2691
02:53:04,208 --> 02:53:06,959
(distant and echoing) Can anyone hear me?

2692
02:53:08,625 --> 02:53:11,125
Is there anyone alive out there?

2693
02:53:17,542 --> 02:53:18,959
We waited too long.

2694
02:53:23,291 --> 02:53:25,792
Well, keep checking them, keep looking!

2695
02:53:26,875 --> 02:53:29,917
(shouting)\nIs there anyone alive out there?

2696
02:53:33,291 --> 02:53:35,667
Can anyone hear me?

2697
02:53:46,125 --> 02:53:49,333
(Rose singing softly and haltingly)

2698
02:53:50,041 --> 02:53:54,000
...my flying machine

2699
02:53:55,625 --> 02:53:59,000
And it's up she goes

2700
02:54:00,417 --> 02:54:03,417
Up she goes...

2701
02:54:07,709 --> 02:54:11,875
Come, Josephine...

2702
02:54:29,333 --> 02:54:33,959
(Lowe's voice, garbled and echoing)

2703
02:54:39,291 --> 02:54:40,500
Jack?

2704
02:54:44,709 --> 02:54:46,583
Jack.

2705
02:54:49,500 --> 02:54:50,709
Jack.

2706
02:54:58,375 --> 02:55:01,625
Jack, there's a boat.

2707
02:55:01,709 --> 02:55:03,542
Jack.

2708
02:55:14,542 --> 02:55:16,417
Jack?

2709
02:55:16,500 --> 02:55:18,458
Jack.

2710
02:55:19,709 --> 02:55:20,709
Jack!

2711
02:55:24,583 --> 02:55:25,959
Jack.

2712
02:55:28,417 --> 02:55:31,375
(faltering) There's a boat, Jack.

2713
02:55:33,458 --> 02:55:34,750
Jack?

2714
02:55:35,792 --> 02:55:38,667
(refrain from\n"My Heart Will Go On" playing)

2715
02:55:44,375 --> 02:55:46,625
(crying softly)

2716
02:56:14,333 --> 02:56:15,875
(weakly) Come back.

2717
02:56:16,834 --> 02:56:18,208
Come back.

2718
02:56:20,333 --> 02:56:21,875
Come back.

2719
02:56:23,375 --> 02:56:24,542
Come back.

2720
02:56:24,625 --> 02:56:27,375
Come back.

2721
02:56:27,458 --> 02:56:30,083
(louder) Come back, come back.

2722
02:56:31,291 --> 02:56:33,542
Hello!

2723
02:56:34,583 --> 02:56:37,250
Can anyone hear me?

2724
02:56:37,333 --> 02:56:39,583
There's nothing here, sir.

2725
02:56:41,333 --> 02:56:42,834
Come back.

2726
02:56:44,250 --> 02:56:45,875
Come back.

2727
02:56:53,291 --> 02:56:55,417
I'll never let go.

2728
02:56:55,500 --> 02:56:56,792
I promise.

2729
02:57:05,500 --> 02:57:09,041
(sobbing)

2730
02:57:19,375 --> 02:57:22,000
(grunting)

2731
02:57:31,458 --> 02:57:33,375
(blowing whistle faintly)

2732
02:57:33,458 --> 02:57:34,875
(blowing stronger)

2733
02:57:36,083 --> 02:57:37,792
(whistle blowing faintly)

2734
02:57:38,542 --> 02:57:40,000
(whistle blowing louder)

2735
02:57:40,083 --> 02:57:41,625
Come about!

2736
02:57:42,792 --> 02:57:44,875
(blowing whistle loudly)

2737
02:57:53,208 --> 02:57:56,500
(whistling reverberates faintly)

2738
02:58:02,875 --> 02:58:07,000
Fifteen hundred people went into the sea

2739
02:58:07,083 --> 02:58:10,083
when Titanic sank from under us.

2740
02:58:11,667 --> 02:58:14,709
There were 20 boats floating nearby

2741
02:58:15,959 --> 02:58:17,959
and only one came back.

2742
02:58:20,417 --> 02:58:21,500
One.

2743
02:58:23,208 --> 02:58:25,959
Six were saved from the water,

2744
02:58:26,041 --> 02:58:27,834
myself included.

2745
02:58:29,041 --> 02:58:33,834
Six... out of fifteen hundred.

2746
02:58:36,709 --> 02:58:41,917
Afterward, the 700 people in the boats

2747
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,417
had nothing to do but wait.

2748
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:49,375
Wait to die, wait to live,

2749
02:58:50,583 --> 02:58:55,166
wait for an absolution\nthat would never come.

2750
02:58:58,792 --> 02:59:02,625
(refrain from\n"My Heart Will Go On" playing)

2751
02:59:59,083 --> 03:00:01,834
Oh, sir, I don't think you'll find\nany of your people down here.

2752
03:00:01,917 --> 03:00:03,166
It's all steerage.

2753
03:00:05,500 --> 03:00:07,500
WOMAN 1: His hair is reddish brown.

2754
03:00:07,583 --> 03:00:11,000
Reddish brown, reddish brown\nand a white beard.

2755
03:00:11,083 --> 03:00:13,250
WOMAN 2: Isn't there another\npassenger list?

2756
03:00:13,333 --> 03:00:14,375
There's no other list.

2757
03:00:14,458 --> 03:00:16,542
Perhaps he's on another ship.

2758
03:00:16,625 --> 03:00:17,709
We're doing all we can, ma'am.

2759
03:00:17,792 --> 03:00:19,792
There's got to be another passenger list!

2760
03:00:41,709 --> 03:00:44,417
ROSE (narrating): That's the last time\nI ever saw him.

2761
03:00:44,500 --> 03:00:48,750
He married, of course,\nand inherited his millions,

2762
03:00:48,834 --> 03:00:52,542
but the crash of '29\nhit his interests hard

2763
03:00:52,625 --> 03:00:55,250
and he put a pistol\nin his mouth that year,

2764
03:00:55,333 --> 03:00:57,458
or so I read.

2765
03:01:10,458 --> 03:01:11,959
Can I take your name please, love?

2766
03:01:15,208 --> 03:01:16,542
Dawson.

2767
03:01:18,583 --> 03:01:19,834
Rose Dawson.

2768
03:01:21,250 --> 03:01:22,208
Thank you.

2769
03:01:28,917 --> 03:01:31,542
We never found anything on Jack.

2770
03:01:31,625 --> 03:01:33,667
There's no record of him at all.

2771
03:01:34,291 --> 03:01:36,792
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

2772
03:01:36,875 --> 03:01:39,625
And I've never spoken of him until now.

2773
03:01:40,500 --> 03:01:41,875
Not to anyone,

2774
03:01:42,667 --> 03:01:44,750
not even your grandfather.

2775
03:01:44,834 --> 03:01:48,750
A woman's heart\nis a deep ocean of secrets.

2776
03:01:49,917 --> 03:01:53,917
But now you know there was\na man named Jack Dawson

2777
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:55,875
and that he saved me

2778
03:01:55,959 --> 03:01:59,542
in every way that a person can be saved.

2779
03:02:01,500 --> 03:02:04,417
I don't even have a picture of him.

2780
03:02:06,750 --> 03:02:10,667
He exists now only in my memory.

2781
03:02:15,208 --> 03:02:18,959
MAN (over radio): Keldysh, Keldysh, Mir 2.\nOn our way to the surface.

2782
03:02:35,542 --> 03:02:38,000
BROCK: You know, I was saving this\nfor when I found the diamond.

2783
03:02:39,875 --> 03:02:43,959
(man speaking indistinctly over P.A.)

2784
03:02:47,667 --> 03:02:48,667
I'm sorry.

2785
03:02:51,875 --> 03:02:56,375
Three years, I've thought\nof nothing except Titanic,

2786
03:02:57,333 --> 03:02:58,959
but I never got it.

2787
03:03:02,291 --> 03:03:03,959
I never let it in.

2788
03:03:11,500 --> 03:03:14,500
(refrain from\n"My Heart Will Go On" playing)

2789
03:04:14,667 --> 03:04:16,667
(enchanting music playing)

2790
03:04:37,792 --> 03:04:38,792
Ah!

2791
03:05:08,875 --> 03:05:11,917
("My Heart Will Go On" playing)

2792
03:07:38,959 --> 03:07:42,959
Every night in my dreams

2793
03:07:43,041 --> 03:07:48,375
I see you, I feel you

2794
03:07:48,458 --> 03:07:55,250
That is how I know you go on

2795
03:07:58,125 --> 03:08:02,417
Far across the distance

2796
03:08:02,500 --> 03:08:08,000
And spaces between us

2797
03:08:08,083 --> 03:08:15,083
You have come to show you go on

2798
03:08:17,542 --> 03:08:21,834
Near, far

2799
03:08:21,917 --> 03:08:25,875
Wherever you are

2800
03:08:25,959 --> 03:08:32,917
I believe that the heart does go on

2801
03:08:37,125 --> 03:08:41,375
Once more

2802
03:08:41,458 --> 03:08:45,542
You open the door

2803
03:08:45,625 --> 03:08:49,709
And you're here in my heart

2804
03:08:49,792 --> 03:08:56,792
And my heart will go on and on

2805
03:08:59,250 --> 03:09:03,083
Love can touch just one time

2806
03:09:03,166 --> 03:09:08,583
And last for a lifetime

2807
03:09:08,667 --> 03:09:15,667
And never let go till we're gone

2808
03:09:18,166 --> 03:09:22,291
Love was when I loved you

2809
03:09:22,375 --> 03:09:28,000
One true time I hold to

2810
03:09:28,083 --> 03:09:35,041
In my life we'll always go on

2811
03:09:37,750 --> 03:09:42,000
Near, far

2812
03:09:42,083 --> 03:09:46,083
Wherever you are

2813
03:09:46,166 --> 03:09:53,166
I believe that the heart does go on

2814
03:09:57,166 --> 03:10:01,208
Once more

2815
03:10:01,291 --> 03:10:05,667
You open the door

2816
03:10:05,750 --> 03:10:09,834
And you're here in my heart

2817
03:10:09,917 --> 03:10:16,834
And my heart will go on and on

2818
03:10:36,125 --> 03:10:40,125
You're here

2819
03:10:40,208 --> 03:10:44,583
There's nothing I fear

2820
03:10:44,667 --> 03:10:51,709
And I know that my heart will go on

2821
03:10:56,250 --> 03:11:00,041
We'll stay

2822
03:11:00,125 --> 03:11:04,625
Forever this way

2823
03:11:04,709 --> 03:11:09,208
You are safe in my heart

2824
03:11:09,291 --> 03:11:16,250
And my heart will go on and on

2825
03:11:53,500 --> 03:12:00,208
(vocalizing softly)

2826
03:12:19,583 --> 03:12:21,291
(song ends)

2827
03:12:21,917 --> 03:12:23,917
(uplifting orchestral song playing)
